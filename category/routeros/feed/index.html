<p>Something I see pop up fairly regularly on a few of the forums, Discords, and subreddits that I hang out on is that the <a href="https://amzn.to/387CKrn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="RB4011 (opens in a new tab)">RB4011</a> is not capable of 10 gigabit routing</p>



<p>Guess what?</p>



<h4>THAT&#8217;S WRONG</h4>



<p>I&#8217;d be lying if I said that this xkcd wasn&#8217;t me sometimes:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/duty_calls.png" alt=""/><figcaption><a href="https://xkcd.com/386/">https://xkcd.com/386/</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Of course, whenever this pops up I&#8217;m not in a position to demonstrate the proof.  It definitely can go almost full 10Gb.</p>



<p><em>But</em> you say<em>, it&#8217;s only got a single SFP+ port!</em></p>



<p>That&#8217;s what full-duplex is for!</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve got a number of these devices and have tested them extensively.  The RB4011 is definitely capable of 10 gigabit routing, in a router-on-a-stick fashion. </p>



<h3>The Proof</h3>



<p>As this is something that comes up almost weekly, I have decided it&#8217;s time to officially document an RB4011 going almost full 10 gigabit.</p>



<p>For this setup, I reset the config on a RB4011 to empty, spun up a simple Debian VM, and connected an existing host and the VM through the RB4011.  </p>



<p>As you can see, the hacky result on my desktop:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_0332-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-302" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_0332-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_0332-300x225.jpg 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_0332-768x576.jpg 768w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_0332-850x638.jpg 850w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_0332.jpg 1685w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h4>The Configs:</h4>



<p>This config is about as simple as it gets.  Two VLANs on the <code>sfp-sfpplus1</code> interface, and IP addresses on the respective interfaces. </p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code># jan/02/1970 00:27:33 by RouterOS 6.45.5
# software id = K5KS-T8WB
#
# model = RB4011iGS+
# serial number = xxxxxxxxxx
/interface vlan
add interface=sfp-sfpplus1 name=VLAN22 vlan-id=22
add interface=sfp-sfpplus1 name=VLAN2222 vlan-id=2222
/interface wireless security-profiles
set [ find default=yes ] supplicant-identity=MikroTik
/ip address
add address=10.22.22.10/24 interface=VLAN22 network=10.22.22.0
add address=10.222.222.1/24 interface=VLAN2222 network=10.222.222.0</code></pre>



<p><code>VLAN2222</code> is a new VLAN I spun up for this test, and <code>VLAN22</code> is an existing VLAN on my network, where a host is running <code>iperf3 -s</code></p>



<p>The Debian VM is also very straightforward.  ESXi, with a few vCPUs (sometimes at higher iperf3 tests, the CPU can get tapped out), and network connected to <code>VLAN2222</code></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="732" height="575" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-303" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image.png 732w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-300x236.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 732px) 100vw, 732px" /></figure>



<p>A static IP and default route, and we are ready to roll:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="751" height="253" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-304" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-1.png 751w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-1-300x101.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px" /></figure>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h2>The Results</h2>



<p>The results sort of speak for themselves.  With an iperf3 to a host on VLAN22 (two streams), we have no issues going 10Gb:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="708" height="826" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-305" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-2.png 708w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-2-257x300.png 257w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-2-300x350.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 708px) 100vw, 708px" /><figcaption>10Gb yo</figcaption></figure>



<p>With a single stream, it fairs moderately worse:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="703" height="305" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-306" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-3.png 703w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-3-300x130.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 703px) 100vw, 703px" /></figure>



<p>Note that is on a basic 1500 MTU network, so I did not set jumbo frames. </p>



<p>And what&#8217;s the CPU doing during this?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="339" height="68" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-307" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-4.png 339w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-4-300x60.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 339px) 100vw, 339px" /></figure>



<h2>Firewalls and IPv6</h2>



<p>While I&#8217;m not going to do it here, I have done testing in the past with IPv6 and firewalling:</p>



<ul><li>With a fairly extensive firewall, the RB4011 will still do 10Gb, a<em>s long as fast track is enabled!!</em> The CPU in this scenario runs at about 80%</li><li>IPv6 performance is abysmal, which is part of the reason I&#8217;ve started moving away from these.</li><li>Without fasttrack, the CPU will be at 100% at about 1.6Gbps.  IPv6 can&#8217;t use fasttrack, therefore IPv6 inter-VLAN stalls out at less than 2Gbps.</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This is going to be a bit of a long post, so I&#8217;ll be brief in the intro. &nbsp;</p>





<p>Over the last few years, I&#8217;ve become enamored with routing. &nbsp;As part of that, I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time exploring the various virtual routing platforms, trying to eek out the best performance possible. &nbsp;So I decided to put them all head-to-head in a virtual setting and see how they fare. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The victims:</p>



<ul><li>pfSense 2.4.4-p3</li><li>OPNSense 19.7</li><li>VyOS 1.2.2</li><li>Mikrotik Cloud Hosted Router 6.45.3, unlimited license (CHR)</li><li>Just basic Debian Buster running FRR</li><li>All tests were done with <code>iperf3 -c IP -P2</code>. &nbsp;I tried a number of different combinations of window sizes, number of streams, etc, and everything was pretty close to equal. &nbsp;UDP obviously gave much bigger numbers, but I&#8217;m interested in TCP for right now. &nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>For the purpose of testing and to make all things equal, pfSense and OPNSense will be running with NAT disabled and <code>pfctl -d</code>, to remove the potential slow-downs from packet inspection. &nbsp;The CHR, Debian, VyOS installs won&#8217;t have firewalls running.</p>



<p>If you are just interested in the final results, they are <a href="/battle-of-the-virtual-routers/#finalresults_kvm">HERE</a>. &nbsp;Or maybe you&#8217;d like the results when I ran the test on ESXi <a href="/battle-of-the-virtual-routers/#finalresults_esxi">HERE</a>.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h2 id="the-layout">The Layout</h2>



<p>They say a picture tells a thousand words, so I think a simple network diagram should illustrate the setup:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="812" height="788" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/network-diagram.png" alt="" class="wp-image-37" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/network-diagram.png 812w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/network-diagram-300x291.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/network-diagram-768x745.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 812px) 100vw, 812px" /></figure>



<p>I&#8217;ll be replacing the firewall image in this picture with the various victims.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve got a <em>LOT</em> of routing going on in my network. &nbsp;At last count, I think I have at least 8 hops from one end of my network to the other, so OSPF simplifies adding new subnets behind various routers. &nbsp;In most cases, I don&#8217;t even bother to add default routes to new hosts as OSPF floods the default route from my edge device. &nbsp;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h2 id="the-hardware">The Hardware</h2>



<p>For these tests, I wanted to use KVM. &nbsp;The network stack on ESXi has been driving me crazy lately, so I was hoping KVM would give me some decent results. &nbsp;Proxmox makes this pretty trivial, so that&#8217;s what I set up.</p>



<ul><li>Proxmox 6</li><li>rootonzfs on an SSD</li><li>64GB of RAM</li><li>D-1521, with Dual X550/552 10G-BaseT ports</li></ul>



<p>This is a more-than-capable machine for these tests, though I will say I&#8217;ve gotten better results on my Broadwell E5.</p>



<p>The networking config on the host is pretty simple. To further isolate things, I have two different ports running as Trunks. &nbsp;Proxmox networking goes over one, and the networking for this test lab goes out of the other.</p>



<p>I did try using OVS, just to see if the results were any different, but they weren&#8217;t. &nbsp;So on Proxmox, the network config is pretty simple:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>auto lo
    iface lo inet loopback

    iface eno4 inet manual

    auto ens2
    iface eno2 inet manual

    auto eno3
    iface eno3 inet manual

    auto vmbr0.3
    iface vmbr0.3 inet static
       address 10.3.1.84/24
       gateway 10.3.1.1


    auto vmbr0
    iface vmbr0 inet manual
        bridge_ports eno3
        bridge_stp off
        bridge_fd 0
        bridge_vlan_aware yes

    auto vmbr1
    iface vmbr1 inet manual
        bridge_ports ens2
        bridge_stp off
        bridge_fd 0
        bridge_vlan_aware yes</code></pre>



<p>All &nbsp;VMs are connected to <code>vmbr1</code>.</p>



<p>The VMs should be fairly equal. &nbsp;CPU-wise, I&#8217;ve gone with 2c2t. &nbsp;RAM is 2GB, which is overkill for basically any of these</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h2 id="the-linux-crowd">The Linux crowd</h2>



<p>The first batch of routers are all based on Linux. &nbsp;The VyOS version I used (1.2.2), is based on Debian Jessie with a modern 4.19 kernel and runs FRR. &nbsp;The CHR is based on an ancient 3.x Linux kernel. &nbsp;The plain Linux install will be the latest Debian Buster, with the repo version of FRR, 6.0.1.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h3 id="vyos">VyOS</h3>



<p>As a contributor, I have access to the current VyOS <code>crux</code> version, 1.2.2. &nbsp;For routing, it uses FRR 7.0.1.</p>



<h4 id="config">config</h4>



<p>The config is painfully simple. &nbsp;Three interfaces, WAN/LAN/LAN2, OSPF, DHCP on the LAN interfaces (for ease of use) and enabling SSH.</p>



<p>As initially mentioned, there&#8217;s been no firewall configured here. &nbsp;I&#8217;m only interested in pure routing performance.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>interfaces {
         ethernet eth0 {

             port 22
         }
     }</code></pre>



<h4 id="boottime">boot time</h4>



<p>VyOS generally boots pretty quickly, at least with a simple config. &nbsp;37 seconds from starting the VM to routing packets. &nbsp;That&#8217;s also with the bootloader timeout. &nbsp;</p>



<h4 id="iperf3results">iperf3 results</h4>



<p>Here are the results of a simple iperf3 test. &nbsp;From <code>10.223.223.11</code> to <code>10.222.222.12</code> &nbsp;:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>     [ ID] Interval           Transfer     Bitrate
     [  5]   0.00-10.04  sec  7.17 GBytes  6.14 Gbits/sec                  receiver
     [  8]   0.00-10.04  sec  7.22 GBytes  6.18 Gbits/sec                  receiver
     [SUM]   0.00-10.04  sec  14.4 GBytes  12.3 Gbits/sec                  receiver</code></pre>



<p>I would be lying if I said I wasn&#8217;t at least a little bit disappointed with those results. &nbsp;Especially since the direct VM-&gt;VM on the same layer2 test shows quite a bit more performance:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>    [ ID] Interval           Transfer     Bitrate
    [  5]   0.00-10.04  sec  11.8 GBytes  10.1 Gbits/sec                  receiver
    [  8]   0.00-10.04  sec  11.7 GBytes  10.0 Gbits/sec                  receiver
    [SUM]   0.00-10.04  sec  23.5 GBytes  20.1 Gbits/sec                  receiver</code></pre>



<p>I guess it&#8217;s just the hardware. &nbsp;</p>



<p>I have a few VyOS VMs on ESXi as my main intervlan routing devices on bigger hardware, and those are capable of 15-30Gbps routing between VMs on the same host depending on how busy the host is.</p>



<h4 id="speedtest">speedtest</h4>



<p>I have gigabit Internet, so I wanted to make sure results are at least close to what I would get natively. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Given that this lab is behind a few routers, and my network is fairly busy at any point in time, these results are close enough to gigabit to count. &nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="830" height="170" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/vyos-speedtest.png" alt="" class="wp-image-38" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/vyos-speedtest.png 830w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/vyos-speedtest-300x61.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/vyos-speedtest-768x157.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 830px) 100vw, 830px" /></figure>



<h4 id="cpuusage">CPU usage</h4>



<p>I was curious what kind of CPU usage there would be under max routing load. &nbsp;Obviously adding a firewall would add to this a bit:</p>

<h3 id="debian-frr">Debian/FRR</h3>



<p>The was just a plain Debian Buster install with FRR installed. &nbsp;Honestly, most of the results are throwaway, since they are largely identical to VyOS.</p>



<h4 id="config">config</h4>



<p>There isn&#8217;t much in the way of special config here. &nbsp;Enabling <code>net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1</code> in <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> is a must.</p>



<p>Networking ( <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code> ):<br></p>

<h4 id="boottime">boot time</h4>



<p>This is the one metric that isn&#8217;t throwaway compared to VyOS. &nbsp;19 seconds from power-on to routing is FAST, and that&#8217;s with 5 seconds of grub time. &nbsp;This means if you are interested in super fast boot times, it&#8217;s probably worth your time learning how to set up a router/firewall on unadulterated Linux.</p>



<h4 id="iperf3results">iperf3 results</h4>



<p>As hinted at, the results are very similar to the VyOS results. &nbsp;Not surprising considering same kernel versions, both are FRR, etc.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code> [ ID] Interval           Transfer     Bitrate

<h4 id="speedtest">speedtest</h4>



<p>With these speedtest results, I must have found a rare moment when the rest of my network was mostly idle:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="456" height="113" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/frr-speedtest.png" alt="" class="wp-image-40" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/frr-speedtest.png 456w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/frr-speedtest-300x74.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px" /></figure>



<h4 id="cpuusageduringheavyrouting">CPU usage during heavy routing</h4>



<p>Again, similar and expected results:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="625" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/frr-cpuusage-speedtest-1024x625.png" alt="" class="wp-image-41" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/frr-cpuusage-speedtest-1024x625.png 1024w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/frr-cpuusage-speedtest-300x183.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/frr-cpuusage-speedtest-768x469.png 768w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/frr-cpuusage-speedtest-850x519.png 850w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/frr-cpuusage-speedtest.png 1128w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>All in all, the differences between FRR and VyOS were pretty minimal. &nbsp;Despite the longer boot times, I would probably just &nbsp;use VyOS, for the CLI and ease of configuration.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h3 id="chr">CHR</h3>



<p>I&#8217;m a heavy Mikrotik user otherwise (multiple RB4011s, CRS317, 326, hex, haps, etc), and CHRs are something I feel like should really perform well.</p>



<p>This is where things started to get a bit funky. &nbsp;I&#8217;ll be honest here, the CHR results were the ones I was most interested in. &nbsp;I have <em>NEVER </em>been able to get decent routing results out of a CHR, I was hoping the proverbial &#8220;blank slate&#8221; would allow me to get the real picture.</p>



<p>The VM was a freshly installed (via systemrescuecd), 6.45.3 CHR, unlocked with a purchased unlimited license. &nbsp;</p>



<h4 id="config">config</h4>



<p>The config here was painfully simple again. &nbsp;A few interfaces and DHCP servers.</p>

<h4 id="boottime">boot time</h4>



<p>Frankly, the boot time was really about the only decent thing about my CHR tests. &nbsp;12 seconds, which is in-line with the other Linux results, there&#8217;s just no 5 second timeout in grub to contend with here.</p>



<h4 id="iperf3results">iperf3 results</h4>



<p>These results really made me question my testing methodology. &nbsp;Abysmal is about all I can say about it:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>[ ID] Interval           Transfer     Bitrate
[  5]   0.00-10.04  sec  1.84 GBytes  1.58 Gbits/sec                  receiver
[  8]   0.00-10.04  sec  1.67 GBytes  1.43 Gbits/sec                  receiver
[SUM]   0.00-10.04  sec  3.51 GBytes  3.01 Gbits/sec                  receiver</code></pre>



<p>I really spent a lot of time fighting these results. &nbsp;They felt way off. &nbsp;Some of the troubleshooting:</p>



<ul><li>Messing with offload settings, both in the host and in the VM. &nbsp;</li><li>Using different NIC types. &nbsp;Maybe the CHR didn&#8217;t like virtio.</li><li>Using a Mellanox vs an Intel NIC. &nbsp;The results were the same whether between the same bridge on Proxmox, to another physical host over the 10Gb Trunk link, etc.</li><li>Changing around all the VM&#8217;s involved CPU cores, RAM, NIC types, anything else I could think of.</li></ul>



<p>In the end, I couldn&#8217;t do anything to really change the results. &nbsp;They held pretty steady at 3Gbps.</p>



<h4 id="speedtest">speedtest</h4>



<p>As mentioned above, probably a throwaway test. &nbsp;I just happened to run this test when my network was a little bit busier.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="804" height="170" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/chr-speedtest.png" alt="" class="wp-image-42" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/chr-speedtest.png 804w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/chr-speedtest-300x63.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/chr-speedtest-768x162.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 804px) 100vw, 804px" /></figure>



<h4 id="cpuusage">cpu usage</h4>



<p>Interestingly enough, the CPU usage on the CHR is quite a bit higher, despite also Linux. &nbsp;I&#8217;m guessing this is attributed to the fact that quite a few networking enhancements and optimizations have occurred in later Linux kernel versions + FRR.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="477" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/chr-cpuusage-speedtest-1024x477.png" alt="" class="wp-image-43" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/chr-cpuusage-speedtest-1024x477.png 1024w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/chr-cpuusage-speedtest-300x140.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/chr-cpuusage-speedtest-768x358.png 768w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/chr-cpuusage-speedtest-850x396.png 850w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/chr-cpuusage-speedtest.png 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>I was <em>REALLY </em>disappointed with the Mikrotik results here. &nbsp;I know RouterOS is more than capable of going faster than those speeds, but I&#8217;m not sure what kind of tweaking it takes to get it. &nbsp;Maybe you need lots of sources and destinations. &nbsp;</p>



<p>I know my RB4011 can do almost full 10Gb (unless you are on IPv6 grumble grumble), CCRs can do way more, so I don&#8217;t know why this thing is so slow. &nbsp;And it&#8217;s been like that every time I&#8217;ve tested it, whether on KVM or ESXi. &nbsp;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h2 id="freebsd">FreeBSD</h2>



<p>It definitely wouldn&#8217;t be a complete test without also testing two popular players in the FreeBSD world. &nbsp;OPNSense and pfSense.</p>



<p>For these tests, a number of important configuration options were applied:</p>



<ul><li>All hardware offload stuff disabled in the VMs.</li><li>Three VLAN interfaces, WAN/LAN/LAN2 as mapped out above.</li><li>FRR plugin installed.</li><li>NAT completely disabled.</li><li><code>pfctl -d</code> . &nbsp;While it didn&#8217;t really impact these tests, I wanted to make sure it was a level playing field.</li></ul>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h3 id="pfsense">pfSense</h3>



<p>I&#8217;ll be honest. &nbsp;I think these *Sense platforms aren&#8217;t really great routers. &nbsp;Can they route intervlan? &nbsp;Sure, but even with FRR somewhat native now, it&#8217;s just a pain and very clunky.</p>



<p>With pfSense, I never actually did get FRR running. &nbsp;It starts, but it just doesn&#8217;t do anything. &nbsp;Not to mention the GUI for it absolutely sucks and is just a confusing mess. &nbsp;It doesn&#8217;t actually impact these tests, but I annoyingly had to create some static routes on my other routers to get everything working. &nbsp;</p>



<h4 id="boottime">boot time</h4>



<p>Not fast, 37 seconds with a few seconds at the bootloader. I&#8217;m also positive I&#8217;ve seen this take considerably longer when it&#8217;s not a basic config.</p>



<h4 id="iperf3results">iperf3 results</h4>



<p>Again these results made me question my testing methodogy a bit:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>[ ID] Interval           Transfer     Bitrate
[  5]   0.00-10.04  sec  1.04 GBytes   891 Mbits/sec                  receiver
[  8]   0.00-10.04  sec  1.97 GBytes  1.68 Gbits/sec                  receiver
[SUM]   0.00-10.04  sec  3.01 GBytes  2.57 Gbits/sec                  receiver  </code></pre>



<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that I&#8217;ve personally seen about 6Gbps on decent hardware, with <code>pf</code> enabled, so I know some of this is due to to the hardware. &nbsp;But I also did try some troubleshooting:</p>



<ul><li>A variety of tweaks on both the host and in the VM with hardware offloading</li><li>Using E1000 NICs. &nbsp;Yeah, that didn&#8217;t turn out too well</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="535" height="101" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pfsense-speedtest-e1000.png" alt="" class="wp-image-44" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pfsense-speedtest-e1000.png 535w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pfsense-speedtest-e1000-300x57.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 535px) 100vw, 535px" /></figure>



<ul><li>Breaking out the VLANs on the host instead of in the VM, and passing in three individual NICs.</li></ul>



<p>Nothing really made too much of a difference.</p>



<h4 id="speedtest">speedtest</h4>



<p>Welcome back to the land of <em>probably-not-very-useful-benchmarks</em>. &nbsp;As before, this easily represents gigabit; my network was just busy.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="522" height="111" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pfsense-speedtest.png" alt="" class="wp-image-45" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pfsense-speedtest.png 522w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pfsense-speedtest-300x64.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 522px) 100vw, 522px" /></figure>



<h4 id="cpuusageduringrouting">cpu usage during routing</h4>



<p>These CPU results are more within line of the CHR results above. &nbsp;Meaning resource-wise, pfSense takes a bit more to route at high-ish (crappy) speeds. &nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="522" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pfsense-cpuusage-speedtest-1024x522.png" alt="" class="wp-image-46" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pfsense-cpuusage-speedtest-1024x522.png 1024w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pfsense-cpuusage-speedtest-300x153.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pfsense-cpuusage-speedtest-768x392.png 768w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pfsense-cpuusage-speedtest-850x433.png 850w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pfsense-cpuusage-speedtest.png 1310w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h3 id="opnsense">OPNSense</h3>



<p>For the most part, OPNSense and pfSense performed mostly identically, to the point where it&#8217;s almost not worth the posting the results. &nbsp;But I will.</p>



<p>I will point out that I was able to get FRR going in about 20 seconds on OPNSense. &nbsp;Whereas on pfSense after hacking around with it for 20 minutes I still couldn&#8217;t get it running.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll also say that I like some things about the OPNSense UI and absolutely hate others. &nbsp;There are definitely some things buried in weird and unintuitive places. &nbsp;</p>



<h4 id="boottime">boot time</h4>



<p>At 34 seconds with 2 seconds of bootloader, this is a few seconds quicker than pfSense.</p>



<h4 id="iperf3results">iperf3 results</h4>



<p>Within the same range as pfSense, similarly disappointing:</p>

<h4 id="cpuduringrouting">cpu during routing</h4>



<p>As with pfSense, the CPU definitely spikes and stays a bit higher during heavy routing. &nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="467" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/opnsense-cpuusage-speedtest-1024x467.png" alt="" class="wp-image-48" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/opnsense-cpuusage-speedtest-1024x467.png 1024w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/opnsense-cpuusage-speedtest-300x137.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/opnsense-cpuusage-speedtest-768x350.png 768w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/opnsense-cpuusage-speedtest-850x388.png 850w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/opnsense-cpuusage-speedtest.png 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<p><a name="finalresults_kvm"></a></p>



<h2 id="final-results">Final Results</h2>



<p>After all these tests, it appears I&#8217;ll probably be sticking to VyOS or Debian for my routing needs. &nbsp;Mostly just for pure routing tasks, which is a lot of what I end up labbing up, &nbsp;Linux seems to do it a bit better.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><th>Router</th><th>Boot Time<sup>*</sup></th><th>Intervlan iperf3</th><th>WAN Speedtest<sup>**</sup></th></tr><tr><td>VyOS</td><td>37 seconds<sup>***</sup></td><td>12.3 Gbps</td><td>878Mbps down/918Mbps up</td></tr><tr><td>Debian/FRR</td><td>19 seconds</td><td>12.2 Gbps</td><td>957Mbps down/932Mbps up</td></tr><tr><td>CHR</td><td>12 seconds</td><td>3.01 Gbps</td><td>845Mbps down/868Mbps up</td></tr><tr><td>OPNSense</td><td>34 seconds</td><td>2.65 Gbps</td><td>888Mbps down/930Mbps up</td></tr><tr><td>pfSense</td><td>37 seconds</td><td>2.57 Gbps</td><td>874Mbps down/896Mbps up</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<ul><li>* boot times all include bootloader waits. &nbsp;Linux-based was usually about 5 seconds (except CHR). &nbsp;FreeBSD-based is 2 seconds.</li><li>** All results are within a margin of error that says &#8220;<em>gigabit-capable</em>&#8220;. &nbsp;My network was somewhat busy at the time I ran the speedtests, not to mention this lab is buried behind two other different routers.</li><li>*** I&#8217;ve seen VyOS take considerably longer once more complex configurations are applied. Upwards of a minute or more. &nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>As mentioned, I&#8217;ve seen pfSense run up to 6-7Gbps. &nbsp;So the slow speeds on pfSense and OPNSense here are almost certainly due to the host. &nbsp;Along the same line, my VyOS routers that run on my E5-2540v4 can route at 30Gbps or faster, so the 12Gbps observed here is slow. &nbsp;</p>



<p>As far as the CHR is concerned, I&#8217;m not sure. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve done extensive testing with them, and even with the unlimited license, I&#8217;ve never see very good performance out of them, at least not without 100 hosts behind them. &nbsp;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h2 id="the-esxi-mutation">The ESXi Mutation</h2>



<p>So before I close this up, I decided to spin up one more set of tests on ESXi. &nbsp;The painfully low pfSense and CHR numbers made me really believe that there was an incompatibility somewhere. &nbsp;Maybe &nbsp;CHR and pfSense just really don&#8217;t like the virtio drivers.</p>



<p>I also only tested VyOS, CHR, and pfSense, since the Debian and OPNSense numbers were largely duplicative.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class=""><tbody><tr><th>Router</th><th>Boot Time</th><th>Intervlan iperf3</th></tr><tr><td>VyOS</td><td>32 seconds</td><td>17.3 Gbps</td></tr><tr><td>CHR</td><td>17 seconds</td><td>7.63 Gbps</td></tr><tr><td>pfSense</td><td>33 seconds</td><td>5.61 Gbps</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>As far as boot times are concerned, the shorter times are caused by being on faster storage, though I don&#8217;t know why the CHR decided to be an outlier. &nbsp;</p>



<p>For VyOS, the slightly increased number tracks with my expectations due to CPU and memory bandwidth. &nbsp;My ESXi server is an E5-2640v4, which runs circles around a D-1521. &nbsp;</p>



<p>For the CHR and pfSense, I wouldn&#8217;t expect the numbers to be over double just due to the platform change, so I have to believe it&#8217;s mostly due to some driver situation.</p>

<p>I think anybody that&#8217;s ever used a Mikrotik and RouterOS can probably agree.  That tiny company from Latvia does things a bit&#8230; different.</p>



<p>Since October of 2017, I&#8217;ve been fighting with RouterOS and switching.  Well, not constantly, but it&#8217;s something that I keep finding reasons to try and hash out.  A few days ago, thanks to a one or two sentence post on Reddit, I finally figured it out.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Back in October 2017, I picked up a CRS317-1G-16S+RM.  This is Mikrotik&#8217;s 16 port SFP+ switch with a single gigabit port, ostenibly for management.  Around that time, I also started using a CCR (Cloud Core Router) for my main edge device.</p>



<p>My requirements were fairly simple:</p>



<ul><li>More than 12 SFP+ ports</li><li>10Gb</li><li>Ability to use VLANs</li></ul>



<p>I wasn&#8217;t worried about any layer 3 capabilities on the switch (at the time), so it didn&#8217;t bother me at all that while the CRS317 was capable of being a full layer 3 switch, it couldn&#8217;t do it at anywhere near line-rate.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h2 id="cloudcorerouter">Cloud Core Router</h2>



<p>The CCR went in without a hitch.  As mentioned, Mikrotik likes to do things a little differently. But there&#8217;s a certain logic to the config, especially if you&#8217;ve ever done any CLI work on something like a Cisco.</p>



<p>A recent photo of the CCR (cabling disaster included):</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog2.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/eaYEoM0-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-101" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/eaYEoM0-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/eaYEoM0-300x225.jpg 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/eaYEoM0-768x576.jpg 768w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/eaYEoM0.jpg 1492w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>For routing, I&#8217;ll say I absolutely adore Mikrotik and RouterOS. I have even started replacing some of my VPSs with CHRs, just because it works so well.</p>



<h2 id="cloudrouterswitch">Cloud Router Switch</h2>



<p>Switching on the other hand is a disaster, and for almost a month when I first had the CRS317, I was unable to even use the switch.</p>



<p>With a CRS (Cloud Router Switch), there are two options.  RouterOS, which gives you full layer 3 capabilites, but potentially sacrifices line-rate speeds if you try and use any routing features, or SwOS, which turns the switch into an almost too-dumb managed switch that only supports LAGs, VLANs, RSTP, and not much else.</p>



<p>The problem was three-fold:</p>



<ul><li>The default SwOS firmware (2.3p) on the switch resulted in a SwOS bootloop.</li><li>The available firmware (2.5) at the time broke DHCP on any VLANs the switch could see.</li><li>Trying to figure RouterOS switching (especially in the pre-6.41 RouterOS versions) was probably one of the first IT related things in a long time that I would honestly say &#8220;defeated&#8221; me.</li></ul>



<p>Until Mikrotik released SwOS version 2.6, around mid-November, the switch was as good as a brick, at least to me.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Fast forward some months and once again I was looking to get RouterOS running on my CRS317.  The reasons were simple.  My RouterOS knowledge had grown exponentially through my machinations on the CCR, and it constantly bugged me that RouterOS on the CRS had defeated me.  Not to mentioned my interest in networking concepts has evolved and I wanted to use some non-router-y layer 3 features, like DHCP Relay.</p>



<p>It helped that the current RouterOS versions have attempted to clean up the switching config.  I say &#8220;attempted&#8221; because it&#8217;s still a bit of a mess, but the bridging system is at least a <em>SMALL</em> measure of improvement over the old master-port config.  Unfortunately, like any transition, it doesn&#8217;t help that the documentation is a bit hard to follow as it&#8217;s a mix of the old and new ways to handle things.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, as the CRS317 is my core switch, I was only able to schedule an hour or two of downtime every other week.  This was not enough time for me to be able to figure it out, not to mention formulate the correct questions to be asking after a failed attempt.  I had posted some inqueries on a few subreddits and at the Mikrotik forums without much luck.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve got quite a bit of experience with Cisco and Dell networking, and have no problem setting up a Cisco L2/L3 switch in a few minutes via a serial cable, but this stupid Mikrotik switch was killing me.  And a some queries to a few regulars that have mentioned they also have these switches told me I wasn&#8217;t the only one finding it difficult.</p>



<p>The standard response was clear. Just stick with SwOS.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h2 id="puttingitalltogether">Putting it all together</h2>



<p>As the weeks passed, I became more and more frantic.  Once again this stupid switch was defeating me. I knew I was close, but every time I thought I had it, my whole network went down.  It turns out that at least part of my problems was because of some dumb RSTP bug on my Netgear switch.</p>



<p>Ultimately, I think that last item, the RSTP bug, was the cause of most of my headaches.  I probably had a working config on more than one occasion, but because the bug knocked down my entire network, I really had no way of knowing.</p>



<p>I also believe this problem was exacerbated by the fact that I think it&#8217;s easy to create forwarding loops with the VLAN filtering that&#8217;s present on the Mikrotik switches.</p>



<p>I have absolutely no idea why I did it with all the problems I was having, but when the opportunity to buy a CRS326-24G-2S+RM for less than $150 arose, I jumped on it.</p>



<p>With a separate switch, and a handful of hours, I was finally able to get it working.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h1 id="routerosswitchingandvlans">RouterOS, Switching and VLANs!</h1>



<p>First off, per the following chart, unless you have a CRS3xx, it&#8217;s probably not worth running RouterOS, at least at this time.  The CRS1xx/2xx disable hardware offload (and therefore line-rate) with just using some otherwise basic features.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="413" src="https://blog2.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Vujbk3P-1-1024x413.png" alt="hardware offload chart" class="wp-image-103" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Vujbk3P-1-1024x413.png 1024w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Vujbk3P-1-300x121.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Vujbk3P-1-768x310.png 768w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Vujbk3P-1.png 1141w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>I&#8217;m also going to assume a basic working knowledge of how to navigate RouterOS. Anybody that&#8217;s ever done a CLI on a Cisco can probably hammer it out because it&#8217;s easy to just <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code> your way through things.  And once the switch is all set up and configured, you can access it via the web ports/WinBox if that&#8217;s your thing.</p>



<h3 id="nittygritty">Nitty Gritty</h3>



<p>I would highly recommend doing most of this via a serial cable.  It is VERY easy to lock yourself out of these things because of the confusing way they handle VLANs.</p>



<p>With the serial cable, you can reboot and navigate the menus to choose RouterOS as the default boot OS (push a key in the first few seconds).</p>



<p>The first step is to ensure you are running the most recent RouterOS version, 6.42.1 at the time of this writing. To check the version:</p>



<ul><li><code>/system resource print</code></li></ul>



<p>If not the current version, you can download the most recent version from MikroTik and drop it in the <code>/files</code>.  A simple reboot will execute the upgrade.  If you get the switch online, you can also upgrade from the GUI or WinBox.</p>



<p>Once you have the current RouterOS version installed, it&#8217;s a good idea to upgrade RouterBOARD too (the boot firmware).  I would also recommend enabling the <code>ipv6</code> package, which for some silly reason, isn&#8217;t by default.</p>



<ul><li><code>/system package enable ipv6</code>, <code>/system routerboard upgrade</code> and <code>/system reboot</code></li></ul>



<p>At this point, you should be on the latest version of everything.</p>



<p>I would recommend a system configuration reset, simply because especially if you are coming from a pre-6.41 version, the migration from master-port to bridge is a bit ugly, at least in how it names things.</p>



<ul><li><code>/system reset-configuration</code> and ignore the &#8220;dangerous&#8221; warning.</li></ul>



<h3 id="defaultconfig">Default Config</h3>



<p>After the switch reboots, and you login (user: admin, no password), it will ask you to either accept or undo the default configuration.  I would accept it.</p>



<p>The default configuration isn&#8217;t bad as it handles some of the tedium for you, setting up a bridge and dropping all the ports on it.  It also gives the switch a default IP of <code>192.168.88.1/24</code> on the bridge (every port), so you could potentially give yourself an IP on that subnet and continue to configure the switch over the network.</p>



<p>You can view the default config with <code>/export</code></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h3 id="startcustomizing">Start Customizing</h3>



<p>The default IP is usually the first thing I remove.  My network is on <code>10.0.0.0/8</code>, and as mentioned above, it&#8217;s way too easy to lock yourself out of the switch with a simple misconfiguration.  So removing it is as simple as:</p>



<ul><li><code>/ip address print</code> &#8211; Shows a list of IPs and interfaces they are assigned</li><li><code>/ip address remove 0</code> &#8211; Remove the number.  In the following example, <code>10.254.1.248/24</code> would be removed.  You can use the above <code>print</code> command afterwards to verify its removal.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="484" height="127" src="https://blog2.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/aFQdad8.png" alt="remove ip" class="wp-image-104" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/aFQdad8.png 484w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/aFQdad8-300x79.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 484px) 100vw, 484px" /></figure>



<p>Next, I set up any LAGs I need.  To do this, you need to remove the ports from the bridge so they can be used in a LAG:</p>



<ul><li><code>/interface bridge port print</code> &#8211; Show all the ports on the main bridge.</li><li><code>/interface bridge port remove 0,1</code> &#8211; Assuming I wanted to put ether1 and ether2 in a LAG in the following example:</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="142" src="https://blog2.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/kr35Z82-1024x142.png" alt="bridge" class="wp-image-105" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/kr35Z82-1024x142.png 1024w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/kr35Z82-300x42.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/kr35Z82-768x106.png 768w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/kr35Z82.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>And then dropping them in a LAG:</p>



<ul><li><code>/interface bonding add mode=802.3ad name=BOND-ToOtherSwitch slaves=ether1,ether2 transmit-hash-policy=layer-3-and-4</code></li></ul>



<p>Finally, add the new LAG interface back to the bridge:</p>



<ul><li><code>/interface bridge port add bridge=bridge interface=BOND-ToOtherSwitch</code></li></ul>



<p>Hopefully, when you do a <code>/interface bridge port print</code> to view the config, you see something like this:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="44" src="https://blog2.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/6J9PHyv-1024x44.png" alt="hardware accel" class="wp-image-106" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/6J9PHyv-1024x44.png 1024w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/6J9PHyv-300x13.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/6J9PHyv-768x33.png 768w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/6J9PHyv.png 1176w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The &#8220;H&#8221; next to the interface name means it&#8217;s hardware accelerated and will go line-rate, also designated by HW=Yes in the same output of <code>print</code>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="105" height="120" src="https://blog2.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/knDUG2Q.png" alt="hwyes" class="wp-image-107"/></figure>



<p>Something else to do now is to ensure that RSTP is enabled on the bridge.  There might be a bug in RouterOS where the bridge refuses to pass traffic if it&#8217;s not.  I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s the case but it&#8217;s something that someone mentioned in a post and I&#8217;m going to take them at their word because of all the problems I&#8217;ve had.</p>



<ul><li><code>/interface bridge print</code></li><li><code>/interface bridge set 0 protocol-mode=rstp</code> &#8211; The <code>0</code> matches the ID from the <code>print</code></li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="901" height="120" src="https://blog2.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/BzLY132.png" alt="rstp" class="wp-image-108" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/BzLY132.png 901w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/BzLY132-300x40.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/BzLY132-768x102.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 901px) 100vw, 901px" /></figure>



<h3 id="switchmanagement">Switch Management</h3>



<p>The next step is to get the switch available on the network, or even able to contact the Internet (for easy updating).</p>



<p>I have separate VLANs for things, but you could easily just put the IP on the bridge too.  I&#8217;m going to focus on the former since VLANs are really where these switches are a pain.</p>



<p>Anybody that&#8217;s set up a Cisco is well familiar with these steps:</p>



<ul><li><code>/interface vlan add comment=Management interface=bridge name=ManagementNet vlan-id=50</code> &#8211; Add a management interface on VLAN50</li><li><code>/interface vlan add comment="SwitchNet" interface=bridge name=SwitchNet vlan-id=254</code> &#8211; Add an interface that can route.  Even if you aren&#8217;t doing any routing specifically on the switch, this is how the switch would access the Internet (mostly for updating).</li><li><code>/ip dns set servers=10.3.1.253,10.3.1.254</code> &#8211; Add some DNS servers</li><li><code>/ip route add distance=1 gateway=10.254.1.1</code> &#8211; Add the default route for the switch.</li></ul>



<p>As you can probably tell, <code>SwitchNet</code> is interface this switch uses to get out to the Internet.  As before, an <code>/interface vlan print</code> will show verify that the interfaces were created:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="961" height="165" src="https://blog2.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/eVPYeTv.png" alt="vlans" class="wp-image-109" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/eVPYeTv.png 961w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/eVPYeTv-300x52.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/eVPYeTv-768x132.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 961px) 100vw, 961px" /></figure>



<h1 id="success">Success!</h1>



<p>So yay!  The switch should be working and passing VLANs.  It should also be accessible via any SVIs you set.</p>



<p>So you&#8217;d think that would enough right?  Well only if you don&#8217;t care about any VLAN filtering.</p>



<p>I have a fairly simple setup from that perspective and I&#8217;m not doing much in the way of VLAN enforcement. Unfortunately, that also includes having a port act as a traditional &#8220;access&#8221; port.</p>



<p>So all the aggravation I&#8217;ve felt over many months is to handle something that would be handled on a Cisco in two lines:</p>



<ul><li><code>switchport mode access</code></li><li><code>switchport access vlan 5</code></li></ul>



<h2 id="vlanfiltering">VLAN Filtering</h2>



<p>This is really where RouterOS switching gets ugly.  Or at least annoying, especially trying to figure out where things belong with the <code>bridge</code>, bonds, ports and VLAN interfaces.</p>



<p>In this case, I think it&#8217;s more useful to take a look at the output of <code>/interface bridge vlan export</code>, which is the raw commands, instead of the output of <code>/interface bridge vlan print</code>, which can include some dynamic stuff, <strong>INCLUDING THE VLANS THAT AREN&#8217;T WORKING!!!</strong>.</p>



<p>That last sentence is what makes it somewhat confusing.  It can help you troubleshoot to a point if something isn&#8217;t working, but largely you&#8217;ll just stare at it and go &#8220;Well the interface is there, why isn&#8217;t it working?!&#8221;</p>



<p>The first step here is to set the <code>pvid</code> on the ports on the bridge <code>/interface bridge port print</code>:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="485" src="https://blog2.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/0wwuhLP-1024x485.png" alt="interfaces" class="wp-image-111" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/0wwuhLP-1024x485.png 1024w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/0wwuhLP-300x142.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/0wwuhLP-768x364.png 768w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/0wwuhLP-1600x758.png 1600w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/0wwuhLP.png 1861w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>And setting the pvid with <code>/interface bridge port set 8,9,10,11 pvid=21</code> and validating with <code>/interface bridge port print from=[/interface bridge port find pvid=21]</code>:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="113" src="https://blog2.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/3PBky5l-1024x113.png" alt="vlan21" class="wp-image-112" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/3PBky5l-1024x113.png 1024w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/3PBky5l-300x33.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/3PBky5l-768x85.png 768w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/3PBky5l-1600x176.png 1600w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/3PBky5l.png 1861w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h2 id="vlanfiltering2">VLAN Filtering #2</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, despite setting the <code>pvid</code>, nothing actually happens in this setup without more extensive VLAN filtering.  The switch is just still rather dumbly passing VLANs.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="90" src="https://blog2.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Fk28kbo-1024x90.png" alt="vlan filtering" class="wp-image-113" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Fk28kbo-1024x90.png 1024w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Fk28kbo-300x26.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Fk28kbo-768x68.png 768w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Fk28kbo.png 1191w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Let&#8217;s talk a bit about what&#8217;s going on here:</p>



<ul><li>Tag VLAN21 on the two LAGs,</li><li>a few other ports on the switch (they are trunks for virtualization hosts,</li><li>and the bridge.  That last piece of information about the bridge is important for later.</li></ul>



<p><code>/interface bridge vlan add bridge=bridge tagged=BOND-CRS317,BOND-UNIFIPOE,bridge,ether17,ether18,ether19,ether20,ether21,ether22 untagged=ether9,ether10,ether11,ether12 vlan-ids=21</code></p>



<ul><li>The default VLAN1 is untagged on the LAGs,</li><li>the same trunk ports untagged from the first filter-set,</li><li>and a few ports which will be ACCESS ports on the default VLAN.  This is necessary as I haven&#8217;t completely my migration off the default VLAN yet for a few things.</li></ul>



<p><code>/interface bridge vlan add bridge=bridge untagged=BOND-CRS317,BOND-UNIFIPOE,ether17,ether18,ether19,ether20,ether21,ether22,ether1,ether2,ether3,ether4,ether5,ether6,ether7,ether8 vlan-ids=1</code></p>



<ul><li>Tag my other vlans on all the ports.  These aren&#8217;t untagged anywhere on this switch.</li></ul>



<p><code>/interface bridge vlan add bridge=bridge tagged=BOND-CRS317,BOND-UNIFIPOE,ether17,ether18,ether19,ether20,ether21,ether22 vlan-ids=2,3,4,6,7,8,9,20,22,42,77,100,146,253</code></p>



<ul><li>Finally, tag two more VLANs to the LAGs to the bridge (important again here).  This is for my Management and default route VLANs.  I <em>COULD</em> combine this with the above, so above it would just be <code>vlan_ids=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,20,22,42,77,100,146,253,254</code>. It&#8217;s broken out here as that&#8217;s how I built it out as I was testing and it worked.</li></ul>



<p><code>/interface bridge vlan add bridge=bridge tagged=BOND-CRS317,BOND-UNIFIPOE,bridge vlan-ids=50,254</code></p>

<h3 id="thecoupdegrce">The Coup de Grâce</h3>



<p>And these are where I kept coming up short:</p>



<p><code>tagged=BOND-CRS317,BOND-UNIFIPOE,bridge</code></p>



<p>The bridge itself must be tagged whenever the associated VLAN is an SVI/accessible IP for the switch itself.</p>



<p>So without VLAN21/50/254 having the bridge tagged on themselves, the switch will block any attempts to contact it over associated IPs.</p>



<p>This was causing me a tremendous headache as I was trying to tag/untag the VLAN interfaces themselves, instead of the bridge, because that&#8217;s how literally every other port/interface on the switch works.  Not to mention that I believe you can accidentally create an internal forwarding loop depending on how you place the <code>bridge</code> on the filters.</p>



<p>Finally, turning on VLAN filtering activates this all, and hopefully doesn&#8217;t lock you out of the switch:</p>



<ul><li><code>/interface bridge set 0 vlan-filtering=yes</code> &#8211; again, the <code>0</code> here would be the number of the bridge from a <code>/interface bridge print</code></li></ul>

<h2 id="thepostmortum">The Postmortum</h2>



<p>Assuming everything went well, the switch should be passing traffic, the access ports should be acting like access ports, and the switch should be responding and accessible on its SVIs.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m using it as a dhcp relay:</p>



<p><code>/ip dhcp-relay add dhcp-server=10.254.1.1 disabled=no interface=ProdUnmanaged local-address=10.21.21.249 name=prod-unmanaged-relay</code></p>



<p>Enabled neighbor discovery:</p>



<p><code>/ip neighbor discovery-settings set discover-interface-list=all</code></p>



<p>Disabled all the unnecessary services:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>/ip service
set telnet disabled=yes
set ftp disabled=yes
set ssh port=22222
set api disabled=yes
set winbox disabled=yes
set api-ssl disabled=yes</code></pre>



<p>Set up SSH key based authentication (honestly this alone might have been enough reason for me to do this) :</p>

<p>And pointed a few gateways at the switch for routing where I don&#8217;t need or care about wire-speed routing.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>So I&#8217;ve finally got it all working.  I&#8217;ve only been working on it since October.  The feeling when I enabled VLAN filtering again (for the umpteenth time) and everything still worked??</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/1PfV0bU.jpg" alt="dafeels"/></figure>



<p>Maybe someday they will release a switch that can do line-rate routing.  Hopefully by then they also will have cleaned up how the VLANs are handled a bit more as this is still a bit confusing.</p>



<p>In conclusion, I actually really like this hardware. I know some people would never buy white hardware, but I really appreciate the asthetic</p>



<p>I&#8217;m even considering buying a few more Mikrotik switches (and am fully regretting a few recent EdgeSwitch purchases). Not to mention I have a US-8 and US-8-150W I&#8217;d love to replace.</p>
