										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In the middle of 2021, it&#8217;s hard to imagine that I&#8217;d be writing a blog post about one of the defining games of my youth, Transylvania.  But with my recent <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.kroy.io/2020/11/19/scorched-earth-with-the-retro-lab/" data-type="post" data-id="954" target="_blank">retro lab build-out</a>, I really took a long walk down nostalgia lane with this one.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>





<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>To understand the kind of games I reach for when the nostalgia gets huge, you need to understand the mid-80s through the 90s.  </p>



<p>Especially during the early part of this time period, there wasn&#8217;t much.  If you got bored or stuck with a game, you couldn&#8217;t just reach out to the Internet for help or a different game.  You could potentially dial up to BBSs, but even then, often these were absolute deserts of any useful information.</p>



<p>For me, this situation was further complicated by the fact that my household owned solely Macintoshes, which meant I had almost zero resources available to me if I ran into a puzzler.  </p>



<p>I think this early training for troubleshooting has lead me to the person I am today.</p>



<p>In any case, my very first computer was the venerable <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_512Ke" target="_blank">Macintosh 512kE</a>.  In the mid-late 80s when we bought this, it was an amazing machine, especially since in the x86 world, Windows was still in its infancy and wouldn&#8217;t gain serious traction until version 3.0/3.1 was released after 1990.  </p>



<p>Recently, I did manage to track down a normal 512k, and with a ROM upgrade, it turned it into a 512kE (essentially)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="756" height="1024" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-4-756x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1032" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-4-756x1024.png 756w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-4-221x300.png 221w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-4-1134x1536.png 1134w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-4.png 1392w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-4-221x300@2x.png 442w" sizes="(max-width: 756px) 100vw, 756px" /><figcaption>Not the original, but a 512k with the ROMs upgraded</figcaption></figure>



<p>Upgrading the ROMs allows it to do new tricks:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="895" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-5-1024x895.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1033" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-5-1024x895.png 1024w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-5-300x262.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-5-1536x1343.png 1536w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-5.png 1606w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-5-300x262@2x.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption><br>I heard you like dem ROM things</figcaption></figure>



<p>Unfortunately, there was almost NO software for it.  So the games I had were limited to a handful that we could trade between a few of friends, family, and enthusiasts that my pops knew. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="843" height="1024" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-12-843x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1173" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-12-843x1024.png 843w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-12-247x300.png 247w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-12-1265x1536.png 1265w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-12.png 1357w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-12-247x300@2x.png 494w" sizes="(max-width: 843px) 100vw, 843px" /><figcaption>Transylvania</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Transylvania</h2>



<p>An absolute staple of my youth was Transylvania.  Some of my first computing memories were of trying to hack out that game&#8217;s secrets.  And it was a&#8230; slow process.  </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="833" height="1024" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-11-833x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1172" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-11-833x1024.png 833w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-11-244x300.png 244w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-11-1249x1536.png 1249w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-11.png 1400w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-11-244x300@2x.png 488w" sizes="(max-width: 833px) 100vw, 833px" /><figcaption>Macintosh Transylvania</figcaption></figure>



<p>A few times a week I would plop down and spend 20 or 30 minutes hammering various commands into the console, usually without much luck.  Funny enough, this is a game that can be conquered in less than 10 minutes if you know what you are doing.  </p>



<p>Every once in a while I would have an epiphany moment, like realizing you could type things like <code>go up</code> or <code>enter house</code>, even though they weren&#8217;t represented as a direction in the text or in the GUI controls.  This would open up a few more possibilities in the game, but ultimately I still was stuck.  </p>



<p>But killing that werewolf the first time was <em>MAGICAL</em>!</p>



<p>And this continued for at least 5+ years, until I eventually got MS-DOS based PCs and started gaming there, at which point I forgot about it for a while.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h2>Transylvania DOS</h2>



<p>Sometime in the middle of the 90s, I discovered the Transylvania DOS port, and was committed to conquering the stupid game once more. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="985" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-13-1024x985.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1174" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-13-1024x985.png 1024w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-13-300x289.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-13.png 1438w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-13-300x289@2x.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>dos the stump</figcaption></figure>



<p>Unfortunately, it didn&#8217;t take me too long to figure out that things were a bit different.  For one, the cross, which you need to kill the vampire, is nowhere to be found:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="410" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-14-1024x410.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1175" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-14-1024x410.png 1024w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-14-300x120.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-14-1536x616.png 1536w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-14-2048x821.png 2048w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-14-300x120@2x.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>no cross</figcaption></figure>



<p>And suddenly there&#8217;s a back to the house, which has a cellar that unless you know exactly what to type, you aren&#8217;t finding what you need:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="405" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-16-1024x405.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1177" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-16-1024x405.png 1024w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-16-300x119.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-16-1536x607.png 1536w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-16-2048x809.png 2048w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-16-300x119@2x.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>two houses</figcaption></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="997" height="1024" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-17-997x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1178" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-17-997x1024.png 997w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-17-292x300.png 292w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-17.png 1405w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-17-292x300@2x.png 584w" sizes="(max-width: 997px) 100vw, 997px" /><figcaption>cellar</figcaption></figure>



<p>And a nailed shut coffin, and inventory limits, which is a ton of fun until you hack out how to kill the werewolf that is constantly harassing you:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="456" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-18-1024x456.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1179" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-18-1024x456.png 1024w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-18-300x134.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-18-1536x684.png 1536w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-18-2048x912.png 2048w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-18-300x134@2x.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>nailed shut</figcaption></figure>



<p>And finally, a super obscure command you need to type in the right place, and it&#8217;s something you have no way of knowing if you don&#8217;t have the original packaging:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="683" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-19-1024x683.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1180" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-19-1024x683.png 1024w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-19-300x200.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-19.png 1440w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-19-300x200@2x.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>enchanted evening</figcaption></figure>



<p>But I eventually did beat it&#8230; after finding a book with solutions to old video games at the local library, which was sometime close to the year 2000.  </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="457" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-20-1024x457.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1181" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-20-1024x457.png 1024w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-20-300x134.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-20-1536x685.png 1536w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-20-2048x913.png 2048w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-20-300x134@2x.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>beat the dos version</figcaption></figure>



<p>And then finally this year, went back and beat the Macintosh version, which is a bit less exciting than the DOS version:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="908" height="1024" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-21-908x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1182" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-21-908x1024.png 908w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-21-266x300.png 266w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-21-1363x1536.png 1363w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-21.png 1400w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-21-266x300@2x.png 532w" sizes="(max-width: 908px) 100vw, 908px" /><figcaption>beat the Macintosh version</figcaption></figure>



<p>Of course, the Macintosh version has an advantage because you can carry the princess:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="456" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-22-1024x456.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1183" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-22-1024x456.png 1024w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-22-300x134.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-22-1536x684.png 1536w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-22-2048x912.png 2048w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-22-300x134@2x.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption> carrying the princess</figcaption></figure>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h2>Remake 2010</h2>



<p>Of course, what retrospective would be complete if I hadn&#8217;t actually remade the game in 2010 for iOS?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="398" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-23-1024x398.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1184" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-23-1024x398.png 1024w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-23-300x117.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-23-1536x598.png 1536w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-23-2048x797.png 2048w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-23-300x117@2x.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>iOS assets</figcaption></figure>



<p>It&#8217;s not in the AppStore anymore, and I only ever sold a few dozen copies of it, but this game was my parody remake.  I wanted to keep the spirit and feature some familiar locations, while coming up with something that was dramatically different. </p>



<p>The goal was to find your &#8220;beloved penguin&#8221; and then escape on the boat:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="268" height="257" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-26.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1187"/><figcaption>penguin</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Your inventory became a fanny pack:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="153" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-25-1024x153.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1186" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-25-1024x153.png 1024w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-25-300x45.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-25.png 1361w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-25-300x45@2x.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>fanny pack</figcaption></figure>



<p>The cross existed and was in the same place, but not to kill the vampire. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="301" height="157" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-37.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1198"/><figcaption>graveyard</figcaption></figure></div>



<p></p>



<p>It was to get out of the cell that locked behind you in the castle:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="304" height="146" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-38.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1199" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-38.png 304w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-38-300x144.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 304px) 100vw, 304px" /><figcaption>locked cell</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>It acted like the eagle in the original game:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>You wave the cross around in the air.  You almost get it moving fast enough to make a pretty picture.  It makes you a little dizzy and you almost pass out.  Suddenly you find yourself someplace different.  The cross disappears in a puff of smoke</code></pre>



<p>Also a cheeky response if you tried to type the stupid &#8220;sing&#8221; stuff that spawned the cross in the DOS version:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>Did you seriously just try to sing something?  Did you think that if you just sung some random song, such as 'Some Enchanted Evening', someone would just magically appear and give you the key to saving   your penguin.  I mean seriously, back in my day, we stored our CROSSES out in the open, like in a graveyard.</code></pre>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>The vampire became &#8220;the slightly derpy vampire who wasn&#8217;t bloodthirsty until you touched his things&#8221;.   This meant he would be in every castle room, but only kill you if you tried to pick something up.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="217" height="267" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-24.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1185"/><figcaption>vamp</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The only way to deal with him was to eat garlic and acid at the same time and burp in his presence, before the counters on the acid and garlic ran out:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>You let out a burp of epic proportions.  The combination of acid and your stomach and garlic breath makes for a deadly cloud that turns the derpy vampire to dust.</code></pre>



<p></p>



<p>The werewolf existed in the form of the &#8220;werezombierabbit&#8221;.  And was just as annoying.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>A evil looking werezombierabbit jumps out of the bushes and menaces threateningly

and if you didn't move away fast enough:

The furry werezombierabbit eats one of your legs and runs away.  Unfortunately, you are in the middle of a dark forest all alone and you definitely need your legs.  You die a few minutes later from werezombierabbit poisoning (not to mention an amputated leg)
</code></pre>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="212" height="227" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-27.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1188"/><figcaption>werezombierabbit</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The only way to deal with him was a multi-part solution.  The original game constantly whispered stuff, so in this game, it whispered &#8220;go over there&#8221; every once in a while.  Which if you went &#8220;over there&#8221; from anywhere in the game:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="614" height="173" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-28.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1189" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-28.png 614w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-28-300x85.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-28-300x85@2x.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption>over there</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>You could move the bushes and find the knife.  </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="179" height="244" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-29.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1190"/></figure></div>



<p>The knife didn&#8217;t exist to kill the werezombierabbit.  It existed to carve out a T-Bone from a loin.  It always annoyed me that you couldn&#8217;t move the rocks in the original game, so I made them movable:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="589" height="169" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-30.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1191" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-30.png 589w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-30-300x86.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 589px) 100vw, 589px" /><figcaption>rocks</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>And when you did this, you got a rock in the your inventory.  Which you would use to throw at the cart:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>For no apparent reason, you throw the large rock at the cart.  The rock goes through the cart and punches a hole in the coffin that is in the cart.  A large beef loin falls out</code></pre>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="583" height="141" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-31.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1192" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-31.png 583w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-31-300x73.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 583px) 100vw, 583px" /><figcaption>cart</figcaption></figure></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="139" height="141" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-33.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1194"/><figcaption>loin</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Which you could then carve:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>You carve the loin into a large T-Bone steak. You discard the rest of the loin and stuff the juicy steak into your fanny pack (kinda gross)</code></pre>



<p>and then &#8220;flavor&#8221; with a toadstool:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="152" height="108" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-34.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1195" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-34.png 152w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-34-150x108.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 152px) 100vw, 152px" /><figcaption>toadstool</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Which was actually a &#8220;magic mushroom&#8221;:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>A large steak flavored with a toadstool, otherwise known as a stoolsteak</code></pre>



<p>Which you can eat:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>While the raw steak was tasty, it was also flavored with a hallucinogenic toadstool.  You waste a couple of hours chasing a green fairy through the forest</code></pre>



<p>or </p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>You feed the stoolsteak to the werezombierabbit.  From the first lick, it is obvious the animal is seeing strange things.  It runs off into the forest in a frollicky manner chasing imaginary puppies</code></pre>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>The main barrier to actually finding the penguin was getting the shovel.  Which was locked up in the tower where the Princess normally would be.  But you needed the ladder to get there, which was in the basement (why you needed to kill the vampire):</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="917" height="161" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-35.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1196" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-35.png 917w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-35-300x53.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-35-300x53@2x.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 917px) 100vw, 917px" /></figure></div>



<p>For the actual lock, you needed the key, which was in the same place as it was in the original game, but in a bit more of a cheeky manner.  I HATED that stupid goblin, so I went a slightly different route:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="319" height="155" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-36.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1197" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-36.png 319w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-36-300x146.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 100vw, 319px" /><figcaption>field</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>With bonus LOTR reference:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>You are standing in the middle of a sandy field.  Using your incredible skills of deduction and analyzing the footprints, you can tell that a person of short stature, perhaps a hobbit or a goblin, recently stood here twirling a small object, perhaps a 'precious' golden thing.  The only exit is W</code></pre>



<p>And if you searched the field:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>You dig around in the sand for a bit.  After a while, you find a small golden key buried in the sand.  You place the key in your fanny pack.</code></pre>



<p>Once the shovel was retrieved, many locations could be dug, but they were all empty save one:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="598" height="174" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-39.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1200" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-39.png 598w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-39-300x87.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-39-300x87@2x.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px" /></figure></div>



<p>Inside the cave:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="295" height="168" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-40.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1201"/><figcaption>inside the cave</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>At the house (which was locked in my game):</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="602" height="167" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-41.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1202" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-41.png 602w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-41-300x83.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-41-300x83@2x.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /><figcaption>at the house</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>This silly junction, which annoyed me in the original game because the exits didn&#8217;t make sense:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="598" height="149" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-42.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1205" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-42.png 598w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-42-300x75.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-42-300x75@2x.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px" /><figcaption>silly junction</figcaption></figure></div>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>You are in another part of the forest.  This part of the forest seems to serve absolutely no purpose.  Going E or S could take you to some random location, but that doesn't make sense.  Because of this, the only exit is back the way you came, N</code></pre>



<p>And of course where the penguin was actually buried, the screen where the statue and alien stuff happens in the original game:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="597" height="162" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-43.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1206" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-43.png 597w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-43-300x81.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px" /><figcaption>field</figcaption></figure></div>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>As in the original game, the way to end the game was to sail away in the boat.  And as in the original game, there was a frog living here:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="557" height="225" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-44.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1207" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-44.png 557w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-44-300x121.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 557px) 100vw, 557px" /><figcaption>lakeside</figcaption></figure></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="264" height="193" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-45.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1208"/><figcaption>frog</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The lake also had piranhas in it.  And the frog was poisonous:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>You now realize that kissing a brightly colored frog was probably a bad idea.  The frog was a poison frog and you die quickly and painfully from the poison on your lips

or

Unfortunately, the frog you have been carrying around was a poison frog.  The poison has been slowly seeping through your fanny pack and into your skin.  You die painfully, rolling around on the ground in the dirt, all alone</code></pre>



<p>The solution was to use the golf club you picked up at some point:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>Since it is such a nice night, you take a couple of swings with your golf club.
One of your practice swings clips the frog.  The frog takes an arching motion through the air and lands in the water.  The frog survives, but unfortunately the piranhas die quickly from the poison on the frog.</code></pre>



<p>Once the fish are dead, you can sail away in the boat.  Of course, a cheeky parody game wouldn&#8217;t be complete without an unceremonious ending:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>You swim out to the boat with your penguin and sail off into the sunrise.  Once you hit the ocean, an eagle swoops down and steals your stuffed penguin.  Moments later a hurricane comes out of nowhere and sinks  your boat.  You die.  Congratulations!  You win! (I guess)</code></pre>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Anyway, it&#8217;s been fun taking this trip down memory lane, especially the stuff about the parody/remake that I had basically forgotten about. </p>



<p>I&#8217;ve tossed all the resources for the game up in an<a href="https://imgur.com/a/bGhgaR4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> imgur album </a>so you can have a closer look if you want.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There&#8217;s a simple reality that most people in 2021 probably don&#8217;t even have a concept of what a BBS (bulletin board system) is, but with my recent <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.kroy.io/2020/11/19/scorched-earth-with-the-retro-lab/" data-type="post" data-id="954" target="_blank">retro-lab musings,</a> I discovered that BBSes are alive and well.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>A huge and defining part of my youth was trolling all the BBSes I could find.  At the time, there was no Internet, so BBSing was my window to the world.  It was basically the only place to find all the new shareware, images, door games, and more.  And later on, it even become possible to exchange messages with BBSes around the world through the use of FidoNet.</p>



<p>In any case, there was nothing more exciting than checking into your favorite BBS and playing a bit of TradeWars, or spotting the newest Commander Keen (4 to be specific), and waiting ALLLLL night for it to download.  Of course it was <em>ONLY</em> 600KB, but that took upwards of 6 hours to download.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="759" height="569" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1046" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image.png 759w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-300x225.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-300x225@2x.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 759px) 100vw, 759px" /><figcaption>Commander Keen 4.  This image alone is 60% of the size of the actual game in kilobytes</figcaption></figure>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h2>&#8220;Dialing Up&#8221;</h2>



<p>Although I was casually aware that BBSes still existed via telnet, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VintageApple/comments/koo70p/new_mac_bbs_captains_quarters_ii/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.reddit.com/r/VintageApple/comments/koo70p/new_mac_bbs_captains_quarters_ii/">recent post</a> on Reddit&#8217;s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://reddit.com/r/VintageApple" target="_blank">r/VintageApple</a> subreddit really caught my eye. </p>



<p>It didn&#8217;t take much work to get my PowerMac 7200/75 connected via telnet to the Captain&#8217;s Quarters II, and I was immediately hooked!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="948" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1-1024x948.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1047" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1-1024x948.png 1024w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1-300x278.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1.png 1337w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1-300x278@2x.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>glorious ansi color</figcaption></figure>



<p>Of course, that was only the beginning&#8230;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h2>Jacking In</h2>



<p>But this wasn&#8217;t enough.  In my original BBS days, i was using either some sort of all-in-one Monochrome Macintosh, or BananaCOM on MS-DOS something on an 8088 Acer, both with some 1200/14.4k/38.4k modems.  </p>



<p>As I&#8217;ve mentioned in the past, when I do something, I do it up big.  So I immediately knew I needed to get my Mac SE connecting to this BBS!</p>



<p>My first attempt was hooking together the Mac SE and PowerMac 7200 via a serial cable, and sharing the PowerMac&#8217;s Internet connection with IPNetRouter.  </p>



<p>Unfortunately, I was never able to get this working, though I did finally get an AppleTalk share set up between the two hosts.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="997" height="1024" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-3-997x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1049" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-3-997x1024.png 997w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-3-292x300.png 292w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-3.png 1398w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-3-292x300@2x.png 584w" sizes="(max-width: 997px) 100vw, 997px" /><figcaption>Macintosh HD is coming from the PowerMac</figcaption></figure>



<p>But MacTCP failed me&#8230;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="766" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-2-1024x766.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1048" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-2-1024x766.png 1024w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-2-300x224.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-2.png 1450w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-2-300x224@2x.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>failure</figcaption></figure>



<p>I was starting to get a little disappointed, until I decided to get a &#8220;real&#8221; modem.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h2>A Real Modem</h2>



<p>Of course, anybody that follows tech knows that modems have been entirely obsolete for a very long time.  Even though I do have some old Mac modems somewhere, the simple fact is I don&#8217;t even have a phone line to plug them into, let alone a number to dial that would be valid in 2021.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s about when I discovered the WiModem232.</p>



<p>To make a long story short, it&#8217;s a device that connects via WiFi and acts like an actual Hayes compatible modem.  Of course, you don&#8217;t dial phone numbers, but in my case, telnet addresses. </p>



<p>It. Was. Perfect.  </p>



<p>I was smart, or so I thought, and ordered up a couple of cables.  One for <a href="https://amzn.to/38Mh33o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my Mac Fleet</a>, and one for my <a href="https://amzn.to/3nN9M7z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">486 running DOS</a>.</p>



<p>It arrived quickly and did exactly what it promised to do.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="761" height="1024" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-5-761x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1051" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-5-761x1024.png 761w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-5-223x300.png 223w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-5.png 1075w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-5-223x300@2x.png 446w" sizes="(max-width: 761px) 100vw, 761px" /><figcaption>connected</figcaption></figure>



<p>Unfortunately, the Mac cable took a few extra days to arrive, so I was forced to &#8220;slum&#8221; it on my 486 and Bananacom.  And Captain&#8217;s Quarters II looks and runs great there too:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="755" height="1024" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-6-755x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1052" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-6-755x1024.png 755w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-6-221x300.png 221w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-6.png 810w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-6-221x300@2x.png 442w" sizes="(max-width: 755px) 100vw, 755px" /><figcaption>cqII bbs on bananacom</figcaption></figure>



<p>A few days later when the Mac cable arrived, I realized the horrible mistake I had made.</p>

<h2>The Mac SE goes Online</h2>



<p>The mistake, of course, was that the cable I ordered was for hooking up an ImageWriter printer, and not a modem.  But amazingly, in the never ending treat-bag of old Mac &#8220;stuffs&#8221;, I discovered I had a DIN8-&gt;DB25 cable for hooking up a modem.</p>



<p>It didn&#8217;t take long to hook it up, but unfortunately things were&#8230; not well.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="789" height="1024" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-8-789x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1054" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-8-789x1024.png 789w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-8-231x300.png 231w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-8.png 1004w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-8-231x300@2x.png 462w" sizes="(max-width: 789px) 100vw, 789px" /></figure>



<p>Fortunately, that was just due to the ANSI colors, which I was able to turn off with a simple checkbox in ZTerm</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="982" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-9-1024x982.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1055" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-9-1024x982.png 1024w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-9-300x288.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-9.png 1039w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-9-300x288@2x.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>And everything looks great:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="913" height="1024" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-10-913x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1056" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-10-913x1024.png 913w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-10-267x300.png 267w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-10.png 1016w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-10-267x300@2x.png 534w" sizes="(max-width: 913px) 100vw, 913px" /><figcaption>looking good</figcaption></figure>

<p>And in attempting to download an old game, the memories of the dreaded &#8220;CRC Error&#8221; came flooding back to me:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="792" height="1024" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-12-792x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1058" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-12-792x1024.png 792w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-12-232x300.png 232w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-12.png 1010w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-12-232x300@2x.png 464w" sizes="(max-width: 792px) 100vw, 792px" /><figcaption>CRC error</figcaption></figure>



<p>That&#8217;s what ZModem is for.  </p>



<p>What I discovered is that this old Mac isn&#8217;t particularly stable over the serial port going past 19,200.  Knocking down the baud rate made it download just fine (and slowly):</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="848" height="1024" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-13-848x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1059" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-13-848x1024.png 848w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-13-248x300.png 248w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-13.png 1233w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-13-248x300@2x.png 496w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px" /><figcaption>downloading&#8230; sloooowly</figcaption></figure>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Of course, what&#8217;s the point here? </p>



<p>I can access Captain&#8217;s Quarters II and other BBSes just fine over telnet from my laptop or workstation.  And since I have a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.bigmessowires.com/floppy-emu/" target="_blank">Floppy EMU</a>, there&#8217;s obviously better ways to transfer files to the Mac SE.</p>



<p>For me, it&#8217;s the nostalgia.  Doing the things I used to do, on the hardware (or similarly enough) to the hardware I used to do it on.  I love this hardware and rediscovering BBSes has opened up a whole new world to me.  </p>

<p>Recently, I got into retro labbing.  Like everything else, I&#8217;ve probably gone a bit overboard&#8230;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>





<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s safe to say that I&#8217;ve gotten extremely nostalgic for some of the computers of my youth.  Old macs, 486s, and all the games from that time period constantly itched at the back of my head.  </p>



<p>Sure, you can emulate this stuff, but it&#8217;s just not the same.  Especially on a modern 4K screen, you end up looking at a game/emulator/etc that is like 3 inches tall.  And if you try to upscale it, it just doesn&#8217;t look right.  </p>



<p>There&#8217;s also something to be said about a computer where you can&#8217;t just flip away to a web browser, Discord, or other distractions.  </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h2>The Beginning</h2>



<p>Like so many other things, this all started on YouTube.  I found myself watching a ton of retro YouTubers like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLx053rWZxCiYWsBETgdKrQ" target="_blank">LGR</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8uT9cgJorJPWu7ITLGo9Ww" target="_blank">the 8-Bit Guy</a>. It didn&#8217;t take too long for the nostalgia to kick in hard, and I rearranged my office, and made a trip to the local Goodwill.  </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0413-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-955" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0413-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0413-300x225.jpg 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0413-768x576.jpg 768w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0413-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0413-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>the first goodwill haul</figcaption></figure>



<p>Unfortunately, I&#8217;m probably a few years too late for the kind of gear I&#8217;m looking for.  All I was able to find was a PS/2 keyboard and mouse, a 4&#215;3 LCD, and a fancy old power &#8220;strip&#8221; to fit the retro theme.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s when I remembered &#8220;the pile&#8221;.  A stack of old computer stuff (mainly Macs), at my parent&#8217;s house.  </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="768" height="1024" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0411-768x1024.jpg" alt="the mac pile" class="wp-image-957" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0411-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0411-225x300.jpg 225w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0411-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0411-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0411-scaled.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /><figcaption>the mac pile</figcaption></figure>



<p>So over the course of a few weeks, I brought home almost a dozen different machines.  Unfortunately, these Macs have had a long hard life, and I was lucky to put together a few working machines from the parts of all.  Some had dead PSUs, others had corroded logic boards from batteries/caps.  Some the CD/Floppy drives were dead in various manners.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0431-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-959" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0431-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0431-300x225.jpg 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0431-768x576.jpg 768w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0431-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0431-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>some performa 6400s</figcaption></figure>



<p>The holy grail of the haul was a 17&#8243; Trinitron Monitor.  It even has the old style BNC connections that I&#8217;ll never use:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0454-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-958" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0454-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0454-300x225.jpg 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0454-768x576.jpg 768w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0454-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0454-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>back of Trinitron</figcaption></figure>



<p>In the end, the haul from the parents house resulted in:</p>



<ul><li>The 17&#8243; Sony Trinitron Monitor</li><li>512K Mac</li><li>One working Performa 6400/180</li><li>One working Power Macintosh 6400/75</li><li>A Mac SE (the pictured Mac Classic was ruined due to leaky caps)</li><li>An array of parts like serial mice (important for the 486 later), IDE DVD Drive, random PCI cards like a Realtek 8139</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0414-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-960" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0414-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0414-300x225.jpg 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0414-768x576.jpg 768w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0414-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0414-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>the initial haul</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Mac Land</h2>



<p>Of course, dealing with old hard drives and floppy drives is a horrible experience, so there were a number of things to make it easier (where I could).  The Macs that have SCSI are a bit more of a pain.</p>



<ul><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amzn.to/36TDC3E" target="_blank">SD Card to IDE adapter</a>.  In the 6400/180.</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amzn.to/38WQhpj" target="_blank">Gotek USB Floppy Emulator</a>.  Can&#8217;t be used on the Macs, but for later use.</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amzn.to/36UbKMS" target="_blank">IDE to SATA adapter</a> and a $10 cheapo <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amzn.to/2KpraBp" target="_blank">SSD</a>.  I bought this just in case the SD card didn&#8217;t perform as well as I would have liked.</li><li>A <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amzn.to/331Qtjj" target="_blank">fancy VGA+Sound switcher</a>.  Not quite as good as an actual KVM switch, but it works great.</li><li>A wide array of cables, adapters, and more.</li></ul>



<p>After getting the 6400 75 and 180 going, I immediately played a few games I loved:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="768" height="1024" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0459-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-961" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0459-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0459-225x300.jpg 225w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0459-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0459-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0459-scaled.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /><figcaption>simcity 2000</figcaption></figure>



<h3>512K Blues</h3>



<p>Of course, the REALLY old Macs were the ones I wanted.  The 512K in particular was one of my very first computers, and there were a number of games I was itching to play again on that natively.  As mentioned, the Classic II I had was dead from leaky capacitors, so I was on a quest to make the 512K boot.</p>



<p>Unfortunately there was a problem.  The initial rendition of the 512K only supported 400K disks, and you can&#8217;t just turn a double sided high density density into a standard density disk that the 512K can read.   So it was off to BMOW and grabbed one of their <a href="https://www.bigmessowires.com/floppy-emu/">Floppy Emulators</a> for Mac.</p>



<p>As usual, Murphy&#8217;s Law kicked in, and I realized the 512K Mac wasn&#8217;t able to boot from &#8220;HD20&#8221; hard drive images that the Floppy Emulator can support.  But I was in luck, and my Grandpa saved the day. </p>



<p>You see, years ago after he passed, I adopted a box of his random stuff.  And in this box, there were a number of old standard density disks.  So with my Floppy Emulator and one of those random disks, I was able to make an &#8220;HD20&#8221; boot disk.  This basically just allowed the 512K to boot from a floppy and bootstrap into a disk image from the Floppy Emulator.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0528-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-962" width="775" height="581" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0528-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0528-300x225.jpg 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0528-768x576.jpg 768w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0528-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0528-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px" /><figcaption>grandpa to the rescue</figcaption></figure>



<h4>Success!!!</h4>



<p>One of the very first games I ever remembered playing was Transylvania on a 512K Mac.  And with the help of Grandpa&#8217;s disk, a hard drive shared out from the Floppy Emu, I was playing Transylvania on a Mac again!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="768" height="1024" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0471-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-963" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0471-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0471-225x300.jpg 225w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0471-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0471-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0471-scaled.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /><figcaption>transylvania</figcaption></figure>



<p>Again, Murphy&#8217;s Law kicked in, as this solution was unsustainable.  All the standard density disks that were in Grandpa&#8217;s box were ancient.  I was lucky to get one boot per 5 attempts.  So after a bit of research, I discovered I could replace the ROM chips in the 512K, and it would boot from the HD20 virtual disk image without the boot floppy.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0506-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-964" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0506-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0506-300x225.jpg 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0506-768x576.jpg 768w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0506-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0506-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>replacing the rom chips</figcaption></figure>



<h3>Mac SE</h3>



<p>Of course, about 18 hours after ordering the replacement ROM chips, I discovered a Mac SE.  Marginally better specs, doesn&#8217;t need any hacking to boot from hard disk images on the Floppy Emu.  The only thing it need was replacing the soldered barrel battery with a button battery:</p>

<p>Using Mini vMac and hooking up the SD card from the floppy emu can help with some initial setup (ignore the SE30 name, didn&#8217;t look at the box when I named the disk)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the itch was only slightly scratched&#8230;</p>

<h2>The PC Conversion</h2>



<p>By far, my most nostalgic gaming years were the 80s/90s/00s.  In particular, Classic Sierra and Lucasarts Adventure games are something I adore, and I still didn&#8217;t have a solution for that.  So it was off to eBay for something that I could run old DOS games one.</p>



<h3>The Micron</h3>



<p>The end result was an old Micron tower, with a SE440BX2, PIII 500 MHz, 256MB of RAM, nice video card, and onboard Yamaha audio. The Micron didn&#8217;t come with a drive, so I dropped in my IDE-&gt;SSD adapter. MAN is that FAST.</p>

<p>I initially had Windows 98 installed (now it&#8217;s XP), and was able to play some old classics, like Leisure Suit Larry 1 VGA Edition.</p>

<p>This is also where I learned the hard lesson of speed-sensitive games, and the mess that old sound cards are.  A lot of the games I wanted to play just didn&#8217;t work, or sounded terrible. So after a bunch more research, it was back to eBay.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h3>The Holy Grail</h3>



<p>After a few days of search, I was able to find what, for me, was the holy grail:</p>



<ul><li>A motherboard with a button cell battery.   No leaky barrel batteries allowed!</li><li>Came with a 486dx2.  Fast enough for everything I wanted to play from that era.  Anything else can be done on the Micron.</li><li>Motherboard was full of cache</li><li>Came with some RAM, though I ditched that and upgraded to a whopping 32MB</li><li>PCI and ISA</li></ul>



<p>Because the board came with PCI, I was able to reuse an old S3 Virge Graphics card, and Realtek 8139 card I found at my parents.  </p>



<p>Plus, I found a pre-ATX 1.2 PSU, which supports -5 volts, which some ISA require.  It might not be strictly required and I&#8217;ll probably upgrade it with a modern ATX PSU at a later date. I also just used my old Fractal R5 case that was leftover from other projects.</p>



<p>Not to mention an array of adapters and cables, like a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amzn.to/35JTXbP" target="_blank">20 pin ATX to AT </a>cable, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amzn.to/3nCBPa7" target="_blank">a CF-&gt;IDE adapter</a>,  a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amzn.to/2UFFRBY" target="_blank">PC Speaker</a> (gotta have that sweet tingy sound in some games), some power splitters, and and array of other cables and adapters (a 3.5-&gt;5.25 bay adapter for example).  </p>



<p>The motherboard arrived like a month later (it came from Ukraine), and it was everything I wanted in more.  As a super bonus, from the BIOS, the cache can be disabled, which makes sound like in Indy256 work, and I can even play super speed sensitive games.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0474-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-974" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0474-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0474-300x225.jpg 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0474-768x576.jpg 768w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0474-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0474-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>486</figcaption></figure>



<p>The assembly was easy, but not very pretty.  All those converters, splitters, and ribbon cables are hell:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="768" height="1024" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0477-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-975" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0477-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0477-225x300.jpg 225w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0477-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0477-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0477-scaled.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /><figcaption>cablemess</figcaption></figure>



<h3>The Gotek</h3>



<p>This is also when I took the opportunity to flash my Gotek with the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/keirf/FlashFloppy" target="_blank">FlashFloppy firmware</a>.  It requires VERY minimal soldering (soldering <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amzn.to/35IrhQH" target="_blank">header pins</a>, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amzn.to/2UJQjIJ" target="_blank">jumpers</a>), and a <a href="https://amzn.to/331Rubf">USB-A to USB-A</a> cable.  And with a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amzn.to/2UHkfFr" target="_blank">cheap OLED screen</a> (soldering a few more header pins and some jumpers), you can have something that&#8217;s INFINITELY more usable.</p>



<p>You just create a fat32 USB stick and drop floppy images on it, or create a floppy as below.  My motherboard BIOS supports 2.88MB disks:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>cp rtl8139.img /media/kroy/GOTEK/Drivers/</code></pre>



<p>or</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>mkfs.msdos -C TRANSFER288.img 2880
sudo mount /media/kroy/GOTEK/TRANSFER/TRANSFER288.img /mnt/disk
cp files /mnt/disk</code></pre>

<h2>The 486</h2>



<p>It didn&#8217;t take long for me to track down everything I needed to start installing my system. I chose MS-DOS 7.1, because I had an 8GB CF card and wanted to be able to use it all:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0478.heic-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-978" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0478.heic-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0478.heic-300x225.jpg 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0478.heic-768x576.jpg 768w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0478.heic-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_0478.heic-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>dos7.1</figcaption></figure>



<p>And with QEMMU, I&#8217;m able to get 631K of conventional memory with mouse, DVD, and other drivers all loaded, something 90s me could only dream of:</p>

<p>and revisiting Transylvania, the DOS version, in full CGA bliss:</p>

<h3>The Sound Conundrum</h3>



<p>As mentioned, sounds on DOS are&#8230; interesting.  It didn&#8217;t take me long to realize&#8230; I NEEDED MIDI!!</p>



<p>Back in the last 80s/early 90s, MIDI was the stuff of legends for most people.  Without it, most games just sounded sort of <em>meh</em>.  Soundblasters and compatibles were okay, but not the best.</p>



<p>When I started this process, I had an old S3 PCI soundcard.  It was just terrible on DOS.  So I ordered an ESS1868, which according to Vogons, wasn&#8217;t terrible, especially for the price. </p>



<p>This was fine.  Until I heard the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a324ykKV-7Y" target="_blank">Monkey Island Intro on MIDI</a>&#8230;. life changed.  Sure, the CD Audio version is &#8220;better&#8221;, but there&#8217;s a charm to midi version.  So it was back to eBay for an SC-55 and a card that has a proper MPU-401 out.  I landed on some ISA Yamaha thing, I think an Audician 32 clone, that sounds great.  And somehow in the pile at my parent&#8217;s house, I found a gameport-&gt;5PIN Midi cable.  Who the heck knows why I had that.  At best I probably hooked up an old time electronic keyboard to a soundcard.</p>



<p>With the MIDI hooked up, all I can say is WOW.  WHY DIDN&#8217;T I DO THIS EARLIER!?!? Especially when coupled with an old Technics amp I inherited from gramps (who knew he would be so helpful in this retro build!)</p>

<p>Of course, it&#8217;s not exactly perfect.  There are some major changes in the sound between an MT-32 and an SC-55.  But I&#8217;m not exactly ready to give up a kidney for an MT-32 yet, and slightly newer games that can use general midi/SC, sound AMAZING.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Here is the &#8220;final&#8221; retrolab for now.  I say final in quotes, because things are always evolving.  I think I want to upgrade the Micron to 768MB of RAM and a faster processor.  </p>



<ul><li>Mac SE + Floppy Emu</li><li>Power Macintosh 7200/75 with stock everything</li><li>Performa 6400/180, drive replaced with IDE->SD, has ATI PCI Graphics and PCI 10/100 Networking</li><li>Micron PIII 500Mhz, running on IDE->SSD</li><li>486DX2 66, 32MB of RAM,  S3 Virge Graphics, RT8139 networking, Yamaha ISA sound card, IDE->CF card for storage, flashed Gotek for floppy disks.</li></ul>



<p>I did pick up a serial/PS2 Intellimouse that I&#8217;m still not sure if I want to open, since it&#8217;s sealed and new-in-box.  </p>

<p>In all, this has become a new passion for me.  And thanks to some foresight of my parents, I didn&#8217;t end up spending too much.</p>
