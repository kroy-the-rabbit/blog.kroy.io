<p>In this post, I explore putting XenServer on these NUCs.  While XenServer is firmly in the &#8220;traditional full-blown hypervisor&#8221; category, it would be a potential alternative to expensive VMWare licenses.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>XenServer is a virtualization platform by <a href="https://xenserver.org/">Citrix</a> that adds VMWare-ish capabilities to the otherwise fairly bare hypervisor <a href="https://www.xenproject.org/">Xen</a>.  Xen is probably one of the most widely deployed bare-metal hypervisors simply due to the fact that Amazon&#8217;s EC2 uses it.</p>



<p>Personally, I&#8217;ve used XenServer in the past in production and hated it.  The internal vSwitch was constantly getting overloaded and bringing down our entire software stack. It&#8217;s not like Xen itself isn&#8217;t capable, but at least when I used XenServer (in the 5.0 days), it had problems.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h4 id="installation">Installation</h4>



<p>I figured as long as I had the platform to mess around on, I might as well give XenServer a shot.  About an hour later <em>(it took FOREVER to install)</em>, it was up and running.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="645" src="https://blog2.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2017-04-12-at-1.38.44-PM-1024x645.png" alt="" class="wp-image-187" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2017-04-12-at-1.38.44-PM-1024x645.png 1024w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2017-04-12-at-1.38.44-PM-300x189.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2017-04-12-at-1.38.44-PM-768x484.png 768w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2017-04-12-at-1.38.44-PM-1600x1008.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>I suppose it surprised me a little bit when I realized a &#8220;fat&#8221; Windows client was still required.  At least on ESXi, there has been an HTML/Flash client available for a while now.  A quick search told me Xen Orchestra was available, but I needed to get the storage set up first.</p>



<h5 id="networkingfail">Networking Fail</h5>



<p>It didn&#8217;t take me long to realize I had a problem.  When I was looking for the USB Ethernet controller to create the storage network, I realized it wasn&#8217;t working.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="602" src="https://blog2.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2017-04-11-at-5.04.30-PM-1024x602.png" alt="" class="wp-image-188" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2017-04-11-at-5.04.30-PM-1024x602.png 1024w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2017-04-11-at-5.04.30-PM-300x176.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2017-04-11-at-5.04.30-PM-768x452.png 768w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2017-04-11-at-5.04.30-PM-1600x941.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The NIC was found, but it wasn&#8217;t detecting the link on itself.  Moreover, every time I rebooted the server and clicked &#8220;Rescan&#8221;, it changed its name to another NIC.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="697" src="https://blog2.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2017-04-11-at-5.04.40-PM-1024x697.png" alt="" class="wp-image-189" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2017-04-11-at-5.04.40-PM-1024x697.png 1024w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2017-04-11-at-5.04.40-PM-300x204.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2017-04-11-at-5.04.40-PM-768x523.png 768w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2017-04-11-at-5.04.40-PM-1600x1089.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Through some command-line hackery, I was able to get the secondary NICs working:</p>

<p>But unfortunately, the GUI still wouldn&#8217;t see the NICs, not to mention that every reboot changed the name of the device, so it wasn&#8217;t much help anyway.</p>



<h5 id="xenserverfail">XenServer Fail</h5>



<p>So that was the end of that test.  Unfortunately if I can&#8217;t even get the basic networking set up (and stable), it wasn&#8217;t going to do to me much good to continue testing with it. I was only marginally interested in XenServer anyway, so it didn&#8217;t really break my heart to move beyond this test.</p>



<p>With that said, these servers are getting tossed into the GParted bootstick blender!</p>

<h5 id="freenaswoah">FreeNAS WOAH!</h5>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>It was around the time my head was exploding from carrying around <a href="/one-media-server-to-rule-them-all-part-1/#exthd">USB hard drives</a> that my brother introduced me to FreeNAS.</p>



<h3 id="mindblown"><mark>MIND BLOWN</mark></h3>



<p>All I could say at the time was <em>WOW!!</em>.  This was around 2010.  I remember this because the version I specifically installed a bunch of times was FreeNAS 0.7.2 (sabanda), and I remember FreeNAS 8 was just coming out in beta.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="559" src="https://blog2.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/freenas7-1024x559.png" alt="" class="wp-image-262" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/freenas7-1024x559.png 1024w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/freenas7-300x164.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/freenas7-768x419.png 768w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/freenas7-1600x874.png 1600w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/freenas7.png 1716w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>FreeNAS was certainly a different beast then.  It was one of the few ways you could run ZFS outside of Solaris, and it was designed to be more of a complete media system instead of a just a storage system that is extensible through plugins/jails/Docker.</p>



<p>Coming from a place where I was constantly losing data due to terrible USB hard drives, ZFS seemed like a jackpot.  So I cobbled together a bunch of old hardware, and created this:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="229" height="198" src="https://blog2.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/first_media_server.png" alt="" class="wp-image-263"/></figure></div>



<p>It&#8217;s a terribly pixelated image, but you get the point.  I think it had five 500GB drives in it and used some old hardware I had lying around.</p>



<p>At the time, I had significantly hacked around with the underlying system to install XBMC (<a href="https://kodi.tv/">now Kodi</a>) as well as finding and getting a video card with HDMI working. This was by no means an easy feat with the state of FreeBSD in 2010/2011.  Plex and simple streaming was still a few years off yet, so I was stuck with a &#8220;fat&#8221; centralized XBMC install on the server, and a couple of micro PCs running XBMC as a client in the bedrooms.</p>



<p>For me, this was an life-changing setup.  No longer did I have to deal with files that I couldn&#8217;t play due to encoding.  No longer was I lugging two or three hard drives between main PC, to load with media, and the Xbox to play a movie.  MKV files suddenly became the <em>crème de la crème</em> instead of the bane of my existence.</p>



<h6 id="freenassourapples">FreeNAS Sour Apples</h6>



<p><em>(Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I respect what FreeNAS has done for the community.  If nothing else, they brought ZFS to the masses.  But sheeeesh, can they make up their minds and calm down?)</em></p>



<p>I love ZFS.  It is amazing and perfect in so many ways.  I can&#8217;t count how many times I&#8217;ve completely messed something up (unplug a live drive anybody?) and had it keep my data safe.</p>



<p>For as much as I loved ZFS, I disliked FreeNAS.  When I first fired it up, it was pretty great.  But soon I realized I wanted move beyond simple DNLA file serving.  Not to mention be able to run custom services, install drives and fire up XBMC without such a hassle.</p>



<p>FreeNAS 8 changed the playing field for me as well.  It made much of the customization I was doing all but impossible. Many of the Linux-ish tools I was using to customize my server were gone as of that version.</p>



<p>In that version, FreeNAS completely changed directions from a &#8220;media centric&#8221; file server to &#8220;serious file storage only&#8221;.  In hindsight, they probably had a good point.  But at the time and with how I was using the earlier version of FreeNAS, it was an annoying shift. Strangely enough, with the upcoming FreeNAS 10 release, it feels a <em>LOT</em> like they are doing this again.</p>



<p>The final straw was the FreeNAS forums.  Have you ever been there?  <strong>TOXIC</strong> is an understatement.  Ask a simple question and you get absolutely crucified.  Even in 2011/2012, it wasn&#8217;t much better.</p>



<h6 id="entertheubuntu">Enter the Ubuntu</h6>



<p><a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> has always been one of my favorite Linux distributions.  Having grown up ordering slackware CDs from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walnut_Creek_CDROM">ftp.cdrom.com</a>, once Ubuntu hit, it was instant love.</p>



<p>My FreeNAS 0.7.2 USB stick died (once again) and I was stuck deciding where to go next.  Every time I needed to reinstall FreeNAS with all my hacks, it made me want to break something.</p>



<p>In almost an act of divine providence, Ubuntu happened to be the first Linux distribution that could run ZFS. And not more than a week before my USB stick died again, they had released the first version of ZFSOnLinux that could mount and import FreeNAS ZFS Pools.  <strong>NO BRAINER</strong></p>



<p>Ubuntu was perfect.  All the great ZFS stuff as well as a huge array of easy to install drivers and programs.  Were there some growing pains with ZFSOnLinux?  Absolutely, but nothing that really endangered the actual data in the zpool.  This is the webpage I visited at least a few times monthly for those years.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="479" src="https://blog2.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ppa-1024x479.png" alt="" class="wp-image-264" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ppa-1024x479.png 1024w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ppa-300x140.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ppa-768x359.png 768w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ppa-1600x748.png 1600w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ppa.png 1706w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h6 id="stability">Stability</h6>



<p>From 2012-2016 I ran on the same pool in RAIDz2 on Ubuntu.  I grew the pool from a single terabyte to over 30TB.  I swapped out drives to grow the pool or because they failed. I upgraded CPUs and motherboards at least three times, expanded RAM, swapped SATA cards and more.  Most importantly, I never once lost data.  XBMC became Plex, and the server started running extra services like nginx/PHP, Grafana and even a few virtual machines via VirtualBox.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="864" height="648" src="https://blog2.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/NBBxwq0-1-2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-261" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/NBBxwq0-1-2.jpg 864w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/NBBxwq0-1-2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/NBBxwq0-1-2-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 864px) 100vw, 864px" /></figure>



<p>And this was &#8220;Old Faithful&#8221; and the setup I ran until earlier this year in 2016.  After 3+ years, I have to believe only the dust held it together.</p>

<p>Since I began my <a href="/the_homelab_mutation/">HomeLab journey</a>, I&#8217;ve virtualized and de-virtualized FreeNAS a few times. FreeNAS has backup and restore functionality, so it should be easy right?</p>

<p>Where it was highly discouraged before, virtualized FreeNAS has been officially supported for a number of versions now. The caveat is that you pass through the storage controller using VT-d, so FreeNAS can access the hard drives directly instead of through some virtual layer.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I always found this to be less than performant. I&#8217;ve never been able to pin down the problem, but with virtualized FreeNAS, my drives and network are always <em>INCREDIBLY</em> slow, despite following all the best practices and tweaks.</p>



<p>This was a VMotion of a VM after <strong>SIX HOURS</strong>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="163" src="https://blog2.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WhenFreenasGoesBadVMotion-1024x163.png" alt="" class="wp-image-266" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WhenFreenasGoesBadVMotion-1024x163.png 1024w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WhenFreenasGoesBadVMotion-300x48.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WhenFreenasGoesBadVMotion-768x122.png 768w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WhenFreenasGoesBadVMotion-1600x254.png 1600w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WhenFreenasGoesBadVMotion.png 1742w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>That was the final straw. It was time to bare-metal my FreeNAS install again. I was expecting <em>MONSTER</em> performance after my <a href="/growing-from-baby-to-giant/">storage rebuild</a>, but it was taking 6+ hours to VMotion a 60 gigabyte VM and not even get to 50%.</p>



<h4 id="learningfrommymistakes">Learning from my mistakes</h4>



<p>Each time I&#8217;ve migrated FreeNAS before, rather than try and keep the same configuration, I just installed fresh and reconfigured everything from scratch. My storage config is reasonably simple, so getting back up and running usually only takes a few minutes.</p>



<p>One thing I learned from these migrations is that it&#8217;s VERY easy to lose the contents of the iSCSI ZVOL. I think it was a test of the FreeNAS 10 Beta that insisted on formatting the ZVOL instead of just using the existing one. I don&#8217;t necessarily think I lost anything important, but I was left annoyed after that. Admittedly, it&#8217;s a beta or I might have just clicked an option incorrectly.</p>



<p>For safety&#8217;s sake, after that experience, I started VMotioning my VMs from iSCSI to NFS temporarily when I was re-doing my storage, since I knew the actual underlying ZPOOL is always safe. But with craptacular VMotion speeds like I was seeing, it was going take the better part of a month to complete that process.</p>



<h4 id="backingupandrestoring">Backing up and Restoring</h4>



<p>When I discovered the following options in the FreeNAS menu, I figured my migration from virtualized to bare-metal was going to be an easy one.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="898" height="601" src="https://blog2.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/backuprestore.png" alt="" class="wp-image-268" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/backuprestore.png 898w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/backuprestore-300x201.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/backuprestore-768x514.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 898px) 100vw, 898px" /></figure>



<p>My confidence was enhanced as I had just done something similar while moving my Unifi Controller from a VM to a physical CloudKey. Moving the controller took a grand total of about 20 seconds of uploading and downloading, so I was hoping FreeNAS would be the same.</p>



<h4 id="murphyslaw">Murphy&#8217;s Law</h4>



<p>Simple plan right?</p>



<ol><li>Backup FreeNAS</li><li>Reinstall FreeNAS on bare-metal</li><li>Restore FreeNAS</li><li>Profit??</li></ol>



<p>Nothing is <em>EVER</em> that simple for me. My grandfather was a Murphy and I seem to live and die by that particular &#8220;law&#8221;.</p>



<p>Upon rebooting after the install, I was presented with a message that said <code>getty repeating too quickly on port</code>:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="501" src="https://blog2.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WhenFreeNASGoesBad-1024x501.png" alt="" class="wp-image-269" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WhenFreeNASGoesBad-1024x501.png 1024w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WhenFreeNASGoesBad-300x147.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WhenFreeNASGoesBad-768x375.png 768w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WhenFreeNASGoesBad-1600x782.png 1600w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WhenFreeNASGoesBad.png 1741w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>That screen was scrolling and repeating faster than I could read it. And the server didn&#8217;t have any network access.</p>



<p>A quick keystroke to change TTYs and I was logged into my FreeNAS system. After some poking around, it appeared none of the the other FreeNAS services, like the web interface, were running. The culprit was the lack of networking.</p>



<p>The problem was that my network interfaces changed. Instead of &#8220;vmx0/vmx1&#8221;, which are virtual devices provided by ESXi, I had &#8220;ix0/igb0&#8221;, which are the physical Intel gigabit and 10 gigabit ports on that server.</p>



<p>The spot on the console menu where it was displaying the <code>getty repeating</code> error is where normally FreeNAS displays the IP address. Because the server didn&#8217;t have any network access, there was nothing to display, so the Console menu was crashing and restarting over and over again.</p>



<h4 id="thesimplefix">The &#8220;Simple&#8221; Fix</h4>



<p>Not having network access seems like it should be a simple fix right? All I really needed to do is get the Console setup menu to to stop crashing so I could reconfigure the network interfaces.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s FreeBSD, so putting manual network information in <code>/etc/rc.conf</code> should be a quick solution? Nope, FreeNAS was overwriting that. Manually setting up the network interface should have been an option too:</p>



<p><code>ifconfig ix0 ip 10.0.1.10</code></p>



<p>No dice there either. Sure, the networking worked and I was then able to <code>ssh</code> into the server, but the menu was still crashing.</p>



<p>As I learned after some more research, the Console menu is just a Python script. This script, instead of reading from the underlying FreeBSD system, accesses all data from the internal database.</p>



<p>Now I know just enough about Python to be dangerous, so I wasted about an hour trying to figure out how to short circuit the &#8220;Configure network interfaces&#8221; menu option. I believe I got reasonably close to a solution there, but then I crashed my system by corrupting the system database.</p>



<h4 id="theactualsimplefix">The actual simple fix</h4>



<p>At that point, I was getting a little nervous. I hadn&#8217;t migrated off ANY of the VMs on the iSCSI ZVOL and there was no way I could risk wiping it. And I had wasted enough time that I didn&#8217;t want to just give up and reboot into the ESX instance on that server.</p>



<p>After some reading, I realized FreeNAS stored its config in an SQLite3 database, and the original backup file I downloaded was a copy of that database.</p>



<p>So I downloaded an SQLite database browser on the laptop, and pointed it at the backup file (of course making a copy of the file first!).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="549" src="https://blog2.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WhenFreeNASgoesBadSolution-1-1024x549.png" alt="" class="wp-image-270" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WhenFreeNASgoesBadSolution-1-1024x549.png 1024w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WhenFreeNASgoesBadSolution-1-300x161.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WhenFreeNASgoesBadSolution-1-768x412.png 768w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WhenFreeNASgoesBadSolution-1-1600x857.png 1600w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WhenFreeNASgoesBadSolution-1.png 1741w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>And there it was. The only place in the whole database that mentioned vmx0/vmx1. So I changed those two database columns to my new interface names.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a great thing about FreeNAS in case you weren&#8217;t aware. It makes snapshots of the root filesystem, so if you made a change or update and it breaks something, you can start up the old system just by selecting an option in the boot menu.</p>



<p>So instead of re-installing FreeNAS to get back to a workable state, I rebooted again, choosing the initial install boot snapshot. Once it was up, restored the now-edited backup file one more time.</p>



<h3 id="success">SUCCESS</h3>



<p>FreeNAS started up, with all of my configuration options in place. From poking around, nothing else seemed to be broken, other than it was still trying to load the VMWare client.</p>



<p>Best of all, my VMotions and file copies were fast again. <em>REALLY</em> fast :</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="546" height="185" src="https://blog2.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fastnetwork.png" alt="" class="wp-image-271" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fastnetwork.png 546w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fastnetwork-300x102.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 546px) 100vw, 546px" /></figure>



<p>After this migration I still have a virtualized FreeNAS instance, but it&#8217;s only my backup array.</p>



<h5 id="postmortem">Post-mortem</h5>



<p>It&#8217;s hard for me to believe this should be acceptable behavior in the backup/restore process. But I reported this over at the FreeNAS forums &#8212; which, btw, they are as friendly as ever &#8212; and was essentially told I was wrong.</p>



<p>Had I just directly edited my backup database to begin with, I could have saved myself a few hours. The install and migration would have been less than a 10 minute process.</p>



<p>The backup and restore process of limited utility if you ever had to replace failed hardware and weren&#8217;t using identical components. It&#8217;s a bit silly that the console menu actually crashes, instead of doing something useful like say &#8220;Hey, I see your network interfaces are invalid, why don&#8217;t you hit #1 to set one up&#8221;.</p>



<p>Of course this is in FreeNAS 9.3.1 and I know that 10 is around the corner. Maybe the final FreeNAS 10 will be better.</p>



<p>In any case, hopefully this will save someone some time in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>For years, I&#8217;ve been running a Media server, outlined <a href="/one-media-server-to-rule-them-all-part-1/">here</a>.  Over time, it&#8217;s evolved from a strict XBMC machine, to an Ubuntu server running Plex, sabnzbd, SickBeard, CouchPotato and more.</p>



<p>I had some concerns with the server itself.  &#8220;Old Faithful&#8221; was a three year old six-core AMD FX-6300 (upgraded from an older AM2 CPU) with 32 gb DDR3 UDIMM ECC RAM running Ubuntu and ZFSOnLinux.  And despite the motherboard, chipsets and CPU all saying they supported ECC, I really don&#8217;t think it did.  No memory or system information tests ever showed ECC capable.</p>



<p>I had lost the main SSD drive in her a few times.  A combination of older SSDs with a bunch of logging was a death knell for those drives. I was using up all the SATA ports and was probably close to lighting a fire with one of these guys (<em>edit, I&#8217;ve learned that this particular model is probably the least fire-prone.  So by accident I picked up the right one</em>):</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="500" height="375" src="https://blog2.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/XcRnKyE.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-278" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/XcRnKyE.jpg 500w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/XcRnKyE-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure>



<p>I didn&#8217;t exactly have room to build in redundancy for OS drives.  So every time I lost the OS SSD, it took forever to get it back up and going.  Most of the important stuff was stored on the actual ZFS array, so at least that was safe.</p>



<p>I also managed to need to RMA array drives on a far-too-regular basis (I blame WD Reds for being crappy).  My particular tower case made it a pain to actually replace said drives when they failed.</p>



<p>Finally, Plex was getting a little &#8220;kerchunky&#8221; on it.  It would handle a stream or two just fine, but anything more would negatively impact everybody connected.  While that server had 6 cores, the cores themselves just weren&#8217;t that powerful (though they were power hungry!).</p>



<p>Here is my setup before I started redoing it.</p>

<p>This was the last picture I took of the old girl before she got retired, after I had ripped out the ZFS array.  That&#8217;s at least 4 years of dust holding her together.</p>

<h5 id="virtualboxfornofunorprofit">VirtualBox for no fun or profit</h5>



<p>I don&#8217;t know that I want to knock VirtualBox too much.  I had been using it for years to spin up random VMs.  But it was when I started to use it for serious home development when it started to fail on me.</p>



<p>Running as a GUI, it was fine.  It just never behaved correctly as a service running under Ubuntu.  A VM that was supposed to start on boot with the server may or may not come up. And if it did, it might have corruption due to the fact that on server shutdown, it didn&#8217;t go down cleanly.</p>



<p>One thing was pretty clear to me.  I needed something else.  I wanted:</p>



<ul><li>A server with some sort of redundancy built into the OS drives.  This priority went out the window when I decided to bare-metal virtualize.</li><li>Something where I wasn&#8217;t stuffing drives into a tower case and trying to maneuver drives around PCI cards and RAM.</li></ul>



<p>It was about that time that I discovered /r/homelab on Reddit.  I followed posts there for about an hour before I <em>KNEW</em> I needed to build an actual homelab.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Sometimes you are sitting on a mountain of gold and you don&#8217;t even realize it&#8221;</em></p>



<p>I spent the next week or so shopping on eBay for an R710.  That seemed to be the recommended server of the time.  It has some power and it wasn&#8217;t too power hungry or loud.  When I found one I liked and was priced right, I put it in my cart.  Then I realized it would probably make sense to check &#8220;The Pile&#8221; first.</p>

<p><em>The Pile</em> is a mountain of retired gear  from my business that has been sitting on my floor since at least 2012.  As this HomeLab <em>WAS</em> going to have a business function (it&#8217;s running as an offsite DR site right now), I decided to dig through <em>The Pile</em> and see if there was anything worthwhile.</p>



<p>Loe and behold, a wild R710 appears:</p>

<p>It was modestly specced, with dual E5520 and 32 GB of RAM, but it was a start.  Continued in the <a href="/the_homelab_mutation/">HomeLab Mutation</a></p>
