<p>For years, I&#8217;ve used a variety of services on my home server.  Much of it revolved around managing media.  Only recently have I adopted Docker, and now I wonder why I have not done so earlier</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Services like Transmission and PlexPy have been staples on my home server for years.  Since the beginning, they were just running on a bare-metal Ubuntu install.  Unfortunately, bare-metal makes it very difficult to effectively back up and manage a bunch of different services.</p>



<p>Once, when the SSD drive the server was running died, it took me weeks to get all my services back to where I wanted.</p>



<p>When I first made the jump to bare-metal virtualization, I replicated this setup somewhat.  But instead of the &#8220;all my eggs in one basket approach&#8221;, I created separate VMs for each service.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Obviously that design is still less than ideal.  It still suffers from the same problem:  configuration files spread out all over the filesystem of the VMs.  Except instead of needing to manage and backup one server, I now had 5-10 VMs each running a single service each.</p>



<p>While I had no problem backing up various configs and databases, it meant every VM was a pile of cruft of copying and rsyncing files to the centralized NAS for backup.  This setup lasted for about 3 weeks before I abandoned it.</p>



<h1 id="enterdocker">Enter Docker</h1>



<p>Anybody that has been following tech for more than 5 minutes has probably heard at least something about Docker.  It didn&#8217;t take long to decide that Docker was a great solution to fulfill my needs:</p>



<ul><li>Centralized configuration</li><li>Easy to backup and restore</li><li>Agnostic treatment of the underlying host.  I wanted to be able to stop the service on one server and start it on a second server with little or no re-configuration.</li></ul>



<p>As I have a rather hefty centralized NAS, my main goal was to be able to run my services off a share on the NAS.  That way, when the NAS is snapshotted and backed up, all my home services are automatically backed up and snapshotted.</p>



<h3 id="dockerhomeproductionv1">Docker Home Production V1</h3>



<p>On the most simple level, running a Docker container can be thought of as just running a single command on the command-line, and having a whole host of services start.  So I created a share on my NAS and exported it via NFS to a rather vanilla Ubuntu install.  The only tweaking that was done was to install the latest Docker PPA.</p>



<p>As I had never really played too much with Docker other than a few copy/pastes to fire up a container, I was starting from scratch.</p>



<p>Version 1 of my Docker setup involved an array of simple scripts:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="667" height="212" src="https://blog2.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/og_docker_scripts.png" alt="" class="wp-image-146" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/og_docker_scripts.png 667w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/og_docker_scripts-300x95.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /></figure>



<p>Where the content of one of these scripts was essentially this:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="578" height="189" src="https://blog2.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/cat_docker_sh.png" alt="" class="wp-image-147" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/cat_docker_sh.png 578w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/cat_docker_sh-300x98.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 578px) 100vw, 578px" /></figure>



<p>This config did a few things.</p>



<ul><li>Stopped and removed the existing container.  This ensured that a fresh version of the container was pulled.</li><li>Stored all the configs in a unified place.</li><li>Gave a centralized layout for sharing between containers that could be accessed externally</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="437" height="71" src="https://blog2.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/docker_layout.png" alt="" class="wp-image-148" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/docker_layout.png 437w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/docker_layout-300x49.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 437px) 100vw, 437px" /></figure>



<ul><li>Set any required environment variables.</li><li>Pulled the container and started it.</li></ul>



<p>Starting all the services was done from a basic systemd config and was a simple as:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>/usr/bin/find /mnt/Docker/scripts/ -name "*.sh" -exec sh {} \;</code></pre>



<p>This setup worked great for months.  But unfortunately I ran into a situation where I wanted to create container dependacies.  So it was time to start using docker-compose.</p>



<h1 id="version20">Version 2.0</h1>



<p>The more I&#8217;ve used it, the more I&#8217;ve learned that instead of being a tool, Docker is more like a full toolbox. When poking around and asking &#8220;What&#8217;s the best way to do X in Docker&#8221;, I&#8217;ve found the number of responses and different methods of accomplishing the same task are numerous.</p>



<p>While my V1 setup was working perfectly and worked without issue for months, I ran into issues when I wanted to create a custom PHP/Nginx container.  While I could have made it work, when trying to create a container with some dependencies, I found that docker-compose was a much better tool in the Docker toolbox.</p>



<p>After a bit of hacking around, I ended up with a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file that looked something like this:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>nginx_ipv6_echo:
     image: nginx:latest
     ports:
         - "8283:80"
     volumes:
         - /mnt/Docker/Config/nginx_php/code:/code
         - /mnt/Docker/Config/nginx_php/site.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/site.conf
     links:
         - php_ipv6_echo:php
 php_ipv6_echo:
     image: php:7-fpm
     volumes:
         - /mnt/Docker/Config/nginx_php/code:/code

 muximux:
     image: linuxserver/muximux
     volumes:
         - /mnt/Docker/Config/muximux:/config
     ports:
         - "443:443"
     environment:
         TZ: "America/Chicago"
         PGID: 65534
         PUID: 65534
</code></pre>



<p>A quick bit of shell scripting gives me a new and improved start script</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>#!/bin/bash
#docker_yml.sh

docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)

hostpath=`hostname --fqdn`
cd /mnt/Docker/scripts/$hostpath
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d</code></pre>



<p>This script does a few important things.</p>



<ul><li>Stops and removes the existing containers.  This cleans everything up so even if containers are running, they can easily be updated.</li><li>Goes into host specific directory.  This allows me to quickly move containers between different hosts.  For example, <code>docker2.lan</code> contains a different yml for that host.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="288" height="82" src="https://blog2.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-14-at-2.48.25-PM.png" alt="" class="wp-image-149"/></figure>



<ul><li>Pulls and brings up the containers.</li></ul>



<p>Finally, a simple systemd file starts and stops with the host VM</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>cat /etc/systemd/system/mydockers.service
[Unit]
Description=Start all dockers on boot
RequiresMountsFor=/mnt/Docker

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/mnt/Docker/scripts/docker_yml.sh
ExecStop=/mnt/Docker/stopall.sh
RemainAfterExit=true
StandardOutput=journal</code></pre>



<p>The <code>stopall.sh</code> just contains the top two lines from the <code>docker_yml.sh</code> file to stop and remove all the containers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="157" src="https://blog2.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-14-at-2.38.19-PM-1-1024x157.png" alt="" class="wp-image-150" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-14-at-2.38.19-PM-1-1024x157.png 1024w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-14-at-2.38.19-PM-1-300x46.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-14-at-2.38.19-PM-1-768x118.png 768w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-14-at-2.38.19-PM-1.png 1552w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The huge caveat here is that anything using SQLite probably should <em>NOT</em> be run on NFS/CIFS shares.  There is a locking issue which can cause problems.  It generally doesn&#8217;t cause problems unless the software being run runs in multiple threads, which most things don&#8217;t.</p>



<p>Plex most decidedly does not like being run off NFS shares.  I ran my Plex library off NFS for years, but since PMS versions around November of 2016, it&#8217;s no longer possible to store the Plex library on a remote drive.  It causes random lockups and other problems.  I fixed this by storing the Plex library on a local drive with an rsync job to backup the Plex library to the NFS drive.</p>



<h1 id="inclosing">In closing</h1>



<p>For me, Docker has definitely fixed my workflow.  Instead of multiple single-use VMs, I have a handful of docker servers, which can be spun up at will.  Obviously this bypasses the clustering ability of Docker, but I think in my use-case, that would be overkill.  For now, this setup has been running beautifully.</p>
